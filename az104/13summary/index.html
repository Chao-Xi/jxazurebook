<li>Each <strong>resource</strong> has a <strong>resource provider</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chatgpt Summary</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Resources</strong>: Resources are the smallest units in the Azure cloud, managed entities like virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks that provide functionality for tasks such as compute, data storage, and networking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Groups</strong>: Logical containers for grouping resources in Azure based on factors like lifecycle, security, or environment (e.g., dev, test, production) to manage and organize resources efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Boundaries for actual resources in Azure, grouping resource groups and associated resources, used as billing units to determine Azure Cloud costs based on accumulated costs within the subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Resource Manager</strong>: Top-level resource in Azure, an orchestration layer that allows management of Azure resources using tools like Azure portal, CLI, and PowerShell through REST API endpoints, interacting with resource providers for specific operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identity and Access Management</strong>: Azure adopts an identity-centric security approach using Azure AD, a standalone identity and access management resource separate from subscriptions, where tenants (e.g., TenantA) with trust relationships manage resources securely across subscriptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions as essential components in managing Azure services and costs.</li>
<li>Utilizing REST API endpoints to interact with Azure resources through Azure Resource Manager, the top-level management service in Azure.</li>
