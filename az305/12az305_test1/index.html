<h1 id="az305-1">AZ305 - 1</h1>
<h3 id="topic-1-question-set-1">Topic 1 - Question Set 1</h3>
<h4 id="question-1">Question 1</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription that contains a custom application named Application1. Application1 was developed by an external company
named Fabrikam Ltd. Developers at Fabrikam were assigned role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to the Application1 components. All users are licensed for the Microsoft 365 E5 plan.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to verify whether the Fabrikam developers still require permissions to Application1. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>To the manager of the developers, send a monthly email message that lists the access permissions to Application1.</li>
<li><strong>If the manager does not verify an access permission, automatically revoke that permission</strong>.</li>
<li>Minimize development effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you recommend?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><mark>A. In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) create an access review of Application</mark></strong>.   ✅ </li>
<li>B. Create an Azure Automation runbook that runs the <strong>Get-AzRoleAssignment cmdlet.</strong></li>
<li>C. In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management, create a custom role assignment for the Application1 resources.</li>
<li>D. Create an Azure Automation runbook that runs the <strong>Get-AzureADUserAppRoleAssignment</strong> cmdlet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An access review in an Azure AD feature that allows an admin to evaluate and verify user access to certain roles and resources.</strong></p>
<p>Based on the question's requirements, 
1. with an Access Review, we can configure periodic notifications about permissions 
2. Enable auto-revocation of access
3. All through a configuration-based approach.</p>
<h4 id="question-2">Question 2</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription. The subscription has a blob container that contains multiple blobs. </p>
<p>Ten users in the nance department of your company plan to access the blobs during the month of April. </p>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to enable access to the <strong>blobs during the month of April only.</strong></p>
<p>Which security solution should you include in the recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><mark>A. shared access signatures (SAS)</mark></strong>  ✅</li>
<li>B. Conditional Access policies </li>
<li>C. certificates</li>
<li>D. access keys  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared Access Signatures (SAS) allows for limited-time fine grained access control to resources</strong>. So you can generate URL, specify duration (for month of April) and disseminate URL to 10 team members. On May 1, the SAS token is automatically invalidated, denying team members continued access.</p>
<p>To enable access to blobs in a container during the month of April only, use shared access signatures (SAS). <strong>SAS tokens can be generated with an expiration time and can be scoped to provide granular access control</strong>. </p>
<p>SAS tokens can easily be generated and distributed to the ten finance department users who need access to the blobs during the month of April. </p>
<p>SAS tokens will no longer be valid once they expire, fulfilling the requirement to restrict access to the blobs during the month of April only. Conditional Access policies and certificates/access keys are not suitable for this task.</p>
<h4 id="question-3">Question 3</h4>
<p>You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that syncs with an on-premises Active Directory domain.</p>
<p>You have an internal web app named WebApp1 that is hosted on-premises. WebApp1 uses Integrated Windows authentication.</p>
<p><strong>Some users work remotely and do NOT have VPN access to the on-premises network.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need to provide the remote users with single sign-on (SSO) access to WebApp1.</strong></p>
<p>Which two features should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Azure AD Application Proxy</strong> ✅</li>
<li>B. Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)</li>
<li>C. Conditional Access policies</li>
<li>D. Azure Arc</li>
<li><strong>E. Azure AD enterprise applications</strong> ✅</li>
<li>F. Azure Application Gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>A: <strong>Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web applications from a remote client</strong>. </p>
<p>Application Proxy includes both the Application Proxy service which runs in the cloud, and the Application Proxy connector which runs on an on-premises server</p>
<p>You can configure single sign-on to an Application Proxy application</p>
<p><strong>E: Add an on-premises app to Azure AD</strong></p>
<p>Now that you've prepared your environment and installed a connector, you're ready to add on-premises applications to Azure AD.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in as an administrator in the Azure portal.</li>
<li>In the left navigation panel, select Azure Active Directory.</li>
<li>Select Enterprise applications, and then select New application.</li>
<li><strong>Select Add an on-premises application button which appears about halfway down the page in the On-premises applications section</strong> Alternatively, you can select Create your own application at the top of the page and then select Configure Application Proxy for secure remote
access to an on-premise application.</li>
<li>In the Add your own on-premises application section, provide the following information about your application.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="question-4">Question 4</h4>
<p>You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com that has a security group named Group1. <strong>Group1 is configured for
assigned membership</strong>. Group1 has 50 members, including 20 guest users.
You need to recommend a solution for evaluating the membership of Group1. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ The evaluation must be repeated automatically every three months.</li>
<li>✑ Every member must be able to report whether they need to be in Group1.</li>
<li>✑ Users who report that they do not need to be in Group1 must be removed from Group1 automatically.</li>
<li>✑ Users who do not report whether they need to be in Group1 must be removed from Group1 automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Implement Azure AD Identity Protection.</li>
<li>B. Change the Membership type of Group1 to Dynamic User.</li>
<li><strong>C. Create an access review</strong>.   ✅</li>
<li>D. Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments</strong>. User's access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access.</p>
<h4 id="question-5">Question 5</h4>
<p>You plan to deploy Azure Databricks to support a machine learning application. <strong>Data engineers will mount an Azure Data Lake Storage account to the Databricks file system.</strong></p>
<p>Permissions to folders are granted directly to the data engineers.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a design for the planned Databrick deployment. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Ensure that the data engineers can only access folders to which they have permissions.</li>
<li>✑ Minimize development effort.</li>
<li>✑ Minimize costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_1.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premium</strong>:  Premium Databricks SKU is required for credential passhtrough.</li>
<li><strong>Credential passthrough</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Athenticate automatically to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 (ADLS Gen1) and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) from Azure Databricks clusters using the same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity that you use to log into Azure Databricks. </p>
<p><strong>When you enable Azure Data Lake Storage credential passthrough</strong> for your cluster, commands that you run on that <strong>cluster can read and write data in Azure Data Lake Storage without requiring you to configure service principal credentials for access to storage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Databricks SKU should be a Premium plan. As the doc states both cloud storage access and credential passthrough features will need a Premium plan</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Premium SKU</strong> for Azure Databricks provides enhanced security features, including integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). By using
Azure AD, you can enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and allow for directory-based authentication.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster Configuration: Credential Passthrough</strong></p>
<p><strong>Credential passthrough allows users to authenticate to Azure Data Lake Storage using their personal Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) credentials</strong></p>
<p>As a result, they will only be able to access the folders and data to which they have been granted permission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Credential passthrough is a legacy data governance model. Databricks recommends that you upgrade to Unity Catalog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="question-6">Question 6</h4>
<p>You plan to deploy an Azure web app named App1 that will use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication.</p>
<p>App1 will be accessed from the internet by the users at your company. All the users have computers that run Windows 10 and are joined to Azure AD.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to ensure that the users <strong>can connect to App1 without being prompted for authentication and can access App1
only from company-owned computers</strong>.</p>
<p>What should you recommend for each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_2.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: An Azure AD app registration</strong></p>
<p>Azure active directory (AD) provides cloud based directory and identity management services.<strong>You can use azure AD to manage users of your
application and authenticate access to your applications using azure active directory</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You register your application with Azure active directory tenant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Box 2: A conditional access policy</strong></p>
<p>Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action.
By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls when needed to keep your organization secure and stay out of
your user's way when not needed.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer - 1: Azure AD app registration - Azure AD app registration is essential to integrate the web application (App1) with Azure AD</strong>.</p>
<p>By doing this, you can leverage Azure AD's authentication mechanisms, including SSO. Once App1 is registered in Azure AD and configured for
SSO, users who are already signed in to their Azure AD account can access the application without being prompted for authentication again.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer - 2: Conditional Access policy</strong></p>
<p>Azure AD Conditional Access policies allow you to define and enforce specific conditions under which users can access applications.</p>
<p><strong>In this scenario, you can create a Conditional Access policy that specifies that App1 can only be accessed from devices that are Azure.</strong></p>
<h4 id="question-7">Question 7</h4>
<p>Your company deploys several virtual machines on-premises and to Azure. ExpressRoute is deployed and configured for on-premises to Azure connectivity.</p>
<p>Several virtual machines exhibit network connectivity issues.</p>
<p>You need to analyze the network traffic to identify whether packets are being allowed or denied to the virtual machines.</p>
<p>Solution: <strong>Use Azure Traffic Analytics in Azure Network Watcher to analyze the network traffic</strong></p>
<p>Does this meet the goal?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Yes</li>
<li><strong>B. No</strong>   ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead use <strong>Azure Network Watcher IP Flow Verify, which allows you to detect trafficc filtering issues at a VM level</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: <strong>IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine</strong>.</p>
<p>The information consists of direction, protocol, local IP , remote IP , local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned.

<h4 id="question-28">Question 28</h4>
<p>You have an application that is used by 6,000 users to validate their vacation requests. <strong>The application manages its own credential store.
Users must enter a username and password to access the application. The application does NOT support identity providers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You plan to upgrade the application to use single sign-on (SSO) authentication by using an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application registration.</strong></p>
<p>Which SSO method should you use?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A. header-based</li>
<li>[ ] B. SAML</li>
<li>[x] C. password-based  ✅</li>
<li>[ ] D. OpenID Connect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Password</strong> - On-premises applications can use a password-based method for SSO. This choice works when applications are configured for
Application Proxy.</p>
<p><strong>With password-based SSO, users sign in to the application with a username and password the first time they access it.</strong></p>
<p>After the first sign-on, Azure AD provides the username and password to the application. Password-based SSO enables secure application password storage and replay using a web browser extension or mobile app. This option uses the existing sign-in process provided by the application, enables an
administrator to manage the passwords, and doesn't require the user to know the password.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p>Choosing an SSO method depends on how the application is configured for authentication. Cloud applications can use federation-based
options, such as OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML.</p>
<p><strong><mark>Federation - When you set up SSO to work between multiple identity providers, it's called federation.</mark></strong></p>

<p><strong>A conditional Access policy that has Cloud Apps assignment set to Azure Windows VM Sign-In</strong> ✅</p>
<p>Enforce Conditional Access policies</p>
<p><strong>You can enforce Conditional Access policies, such as multifactor authentication or user sign-in risk check</strong>, before you authorize access to Windows
VMs in Azure that are enabled with Azure AD login. To apply a Conditional Access policy, you must select the Azure Windows VM Sign-In app from
the cloud apps or actions assignment option. Then use sign-in risk as a condition and/or require MFA as a control for granting access.</p>
<p>The JIT VM access page opens listing the ports that Defender for Cloud recommends protecting:</p>

<p><strong>You apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You use Azure Policy to enforce tagging rules and conventions.</strong></p>
<p>By creating a policy, you avoid the scenario of resources being deployed to your subscription that don't have the expected tags for your organization. Instead of manually applying tags or searching for resources that aren't

<p><strong>You can use the capabilities in Azure Active Directory B2B to collaborate with external guest users and you can use Azure RBAC to grant just the permissions that guest users need in your environment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p>Not B: Forest trust is used for internal security, not external access.</p>
<p>Collaborate with any partner using their identities</p>
<p>With Azure AD B2B, the partner uses their own identity management solution, so there is no external administrative overhead for your organization. Guest users sign in to your apps and services with their own work, school, or social identities.</p>

<li>[ ] B. Azure Arc</li>
<li>[ ] C. Azure Analysis Services</li>
<li>[ ] D. Application Insights</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: A</p>
<p><strong>The Activity log is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. Activity log includes such information as when a
resource is modified or when a virtual machine is started.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity log events are retained in Azure for 90 days and then deleted.</strong></p>
<p>For more functionality, you should create a diagnostic setting to send the Activity log to one or more of these locations for the following
reasons: <strong>to Azure Monitor Logs for more complex querying and alerting, and longer retention (up to two years) to Azure Event Hubs to forward
outside of Azure to Azure Storage for cheaper, long-term archiving</strong></p>
<p>Note: Azure Monitor builds on top of Log Analytics, the platform service that gathers log and metrics data from all your resources. The easiest
way to think about it is that Azure Monitor is the marketing name, whereas Log Analytics is the technology that powers it.</p>
<h4 id="question-35">Question 35</h4>
<p>You are developing an app that will read activity logs for an Azure subscription by using Azure Functions.</p>
<p><strong>You need to recommend an authentication solution for Azure Functions</strong>. <strong>The solution must minimize administrative effort.</strong></p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>

<li>[x] B. <strong>system-assigned managed identities  ✅</strong></li>
<li>[ ] C. shared access signatures (SAS)</li>
<li>[ ] D. application registration in Azure AD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System-assigned managed identities provide a way for Azure Functions to authenticate to other Azure services, such as Activity Logs, without the
need for storing or managing secrets.</strong> </p>
<p>This approach minimizes administrative effort because the identity is tied directly to the Azure Functions
service and is automatically managed by Azure. When the Azure Functions instance is deleted, the associated managed identity will also be
removed. This simplifies the authentication process and helps improve the security posture of your app.</p>
<p>A common challenge for developers is the management of secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used to secure communication between
services. Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage these credential</p>
<p><strong>System-assigned. Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the resource.</strong> When you
enable a system-assigned managed identity:</p>
<ul>
<li>A service principal of a special type is created in Azure AD for the identity. The service principal is tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource. When the Azure resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the service principal for you.</li>
<li>By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.</li>
<li>You authorize the managed identity to have access to one or more services.</li>
<li>The name of the system-assigned service principal is always the same as the name of the Azure resource it is created for.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-36">Question 36</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure key vault named KV1 and a virtual machine named VM1. VM1 runs Windows Server 2022:
Azure Edition.</p>
<p>You plan to deploy an ASP.Net Core-based application named App1 to VM1.</p>
<p>You need to configure App1 to use a system-assigned managed identity to retrieve secrets from KV1. The solution must minimize development
effort.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Configure App1 to use a REST API call to retrieve an authentication token from the: Azure Instance Metadata (IMDS) endpoint</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>The key difference in this scenario is that we are using a Managed Identity, which is a feature of Azure AD, and in that case, access tokens are
obtained through the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) API. </p>
<p><strong>The managed identity is responsible for managing the lifecycle of these credentials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, for the case of an application in an Azure VM that uses a managed identity to authenticate with Key Vault, the IMDS would be used, not an OAuth 2.0 endpoint directly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>System-assigned managed identities provide a way for Azure Functions to authenticate to other Azure services, such as Activity Logs, without the need for storing or managing secrets.</strong></p>
<p>Azure Functions provide a Managed Identity and since the question is about Azure Functions not about the App being developed, the correct answer is B.</p>

<h4 id="question-52">Question 52</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription.</p>
<p>You plan to deploy five storage accounts that will store block blobs and five storage accounts that will host file shares. The file shares will be
accessed by using the SMB protocol</p>
<p>You need to recommend an access authorization solution for the storage accounts. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize security.</li>
<li>Prevent the use of shared keys.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, support time-limited access.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the solution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p><strong>1. For the blobs - a user delegation SAS only</strong></p>
<p>To maximize security it's better to use a user delegation SAS:</p>
<p>From docs: As a security best practice, <strong>we recommend that you use Azure AD credentials when possible</strong>, rather than the account key, which can be more easily compromised. When your application design requires shared access signatures, use Azure AD credentials to create a user delegation SAS to help ensure better security.</p>
<p>This also prevents using shared keys &amp; supports time-limited access. Note: user delegation SAS do not support stored access policies.</p>
<p><strong>2. For the file shares - Azure AD credentials</strong></p>
<p>It fulfills the requirement to maximize security (the most secure way recommended by Microsoft), but doesn't support time-limited access, which is
optional and has lower priority than security.</p>
<h4 id="question-53">Question 53</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Box1 - Azure Monitor Data collection</strong>  ✅</li>
<li><strong>Box2 - KQL</strong>    ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>For those arguing XPATH over KQL, as far as I can tell, XPATH can only filter (not transform) event log data that is sent to a Log Analytics
workspace. </p>
<p>KQL, on the other hand, can be used for ingestion-time transformations that allow for filtering or modification of incoming data
before it's stored in a Log Analytics workspace.
<strong>So Box 2 should indeed be KQL</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="question-54">Question 54</h4>

<h4 id="question-14_1">Question 14</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription.</p>
<p>Your on-premises network contains a file server named Server1. Server1 stores 5 of company files that are accessed rarely.</p>
<p><strong>You plan to copy the files to Azure Storage.</strong></p>
<p>You need to implement a storage solution for the files that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ The files must be available within 24 hours of being requested.</li>
<li>✑ <strong>Storage costs must be minimized.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Which two possible storage solutions achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<ul>
<li>[X] A. <strong>Create an Azure Blob Storage account that is configured for the Cool default access tier. Create a blob container, copy the files to the blob container, and set each file to the Archive access tier</strong>.   ✅ </li>
<li>[ ] B. Create a general-purpose v1 storage account. Create a blob container and copy the files to the blob container.</li>
<li>[ ] C. Create a general-purpose v2 storage account that is configured for the Cool default access tier. Create a file share in the storage account and copy the files to the file share.</li>
<li>[X] D. <strong>Create a general-purpose v2 storage account that is configured for the Hot default access tier. Create a blob container, copy the files to the blob container, and set each file to the Archive access tier</strong>.   ✅</li>
<li>[ ] E. Create a general-purpose v1 storage account. Create a file share in the storage account and copy the files to the file share.</li>
</ul>
<p>To minimize costs: <strong>The Archive tier is optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours).</strong></p>
<p>The available access tiers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.</li>
<li>Cool: Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.</li>
<li>Archive: Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of
hours).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the files are accessed rarely and you need to minimize storage costs, <strong>the Archive tier is appropriate. Both A and D suggest setting the files to the Archive access tier.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that Archive tier data is offline and it takes time to rehydrate data to an online tier if/when access is needed, but it satisfies your
requirement of the files being available within 24 hours of being requested. In addition, creating an Azure Blob Storage or general-purpose v2
storage account allows you to utilize these access tiers, as they are not available in the general-purpose v1 accounts.</p>
<h4 id="question-15_1">Question 15</h4>
<p>You have an app named App1 that uses two on-premises Microsoft SQL Server databases named DB1 and DB2.
You plan to migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure</p>
<p>You need to recommend an Azure solution to host DB1 and DB2. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Support server-side transactions across DB1 and DB2.</li>
<li>✑ Minimize administrative effort to update the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you recommend?</p>
<ul>

<li>[ ] C. two databases on the same SQL Server instance on an Azure virtual machine</li>
<li>[ ] D. two Azure SQL databases on different Azure SQL Database servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Elastic database transactions for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance allow you to run transactions that span several databases.</p>
<p>SQL Managed Instance enables system administrators to spend less time on administrative tasks because the service either performs them for you or greatly simplifies those tasks</p>
<p>A server-side distributed transactions using Transact-SQL are available only for Azure SQL Managed Instance. Distributed transaction can be

<p>You need to design a highly available Azure SQL database that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Failover between replicas of the database must occur without any data loss.</li>
<li>✑ <strong>The database must remain available in the event of a zone outage</strong>.</li>
<li>✑ Costs must be minimized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which deployment option should you use?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A. Azure SQL Database Hyperscale</li>
<li>[X] B. <strong>Azure SQL Database Premium</strong> ✅</li>
<li>[ ] C. Azure SQL Database Basic</li>
<li>[ ] D. Azure SQL Managed Instance General Purpose</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Premium &gt; Serverless &gt; Business Critical</strong></p>
<p><strong>Azure SQL Database Premium tier supports multiple redundant replicas for each database that are automatically provisioned in the same datacenter within a region.</strong> </p>
<p>This design leverages the SQL Server AlwaysON technology and provides resilience to server failures with 99.99% availability SLA and RPO=0.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Azure Availability Zones, we are happy to announce that SQL Database now offers built-in support of Availability Zones
in its Premium service tier.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not A: Hyperscale is more expensive than Premium.</strong></li>
<li>Not C: Need Premium for Availability Zones.</li>
<li><strong>Not D: Zone redundant configuration that is free on Azure SQL Premium is not available on Azure SQL Managed Instance.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Azure SQL Database Premium</strong></p>
<p>To meet the requirements of a highly available Azure SQL database with no data loss during failover and availability during a zone outage, you
should use Azure SQL Database Premium. The Premium tier provides built-in support for active geo-replication, which allows you to create
readable secondary replicas in different regions, ensuring the database remains available in the event of a zone outage. Additionally, the Premium
tier offers better performance and more resources compared to the Basic and General Purpose tiers, while Hyperscale, although highly scalable,
can be more costly than the Premium tier.</p>
<h4 id="question-17_1">Question 17</h4>
<p>You are planning an Azure Storage solution for sensitive data. The data will be accessed daily. The dataset is less than 10 GB.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a storage solution that meets the following requirements:</p>

<li>✑ All the data written to storage must be retained for five years.</li>
<li>✑ Once the data is written, the data can only be read. Modifications and deletion must be prevented.</li>
<li>✑ After five years, the data can be deleted, but never modified.</li>
<li>✑ <strong>Data access charges must be minimized</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_43.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: General purpose v2 with Hot access tier for blobs</strong></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the data written to storage must be retained for five years.</li>
<li><strong>Data access charges must be minimized</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hot tier has higher storage costs, but lower access and transaction costs.</strong></p>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not Archive: Lowest storage costs, but highest access, and transaction costs.</li>
<li>Not Cool: Lower storage costs, but higher access and transaction costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Box 1:</strong></p>
<p>Answer is container access (immutable) policy <strong>at least at the container scope.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Storage Account type: c. GP v2 Hot.</strong></p>
<p>Considering the data will be accessed daily, the Hot access tier is the most cost-effective for storing frequently accessed data.</p>
<p><strong>Box 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Configuration to prevent the modification and deletions: Container access policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>set the resources lock as read-only and delete prevention but can to for data, that is only for resources change not for in the data.</strong></p>
<p>The Container access policy is indeed the place to configure Azure's Immutable Blob Storage to ensure data is retained without modifications or
deletions for a specified amount of time, which suits your needs. The Azure Blob Storage's Immutable Blob Storage feature provides a WORM
(Write Once, Read Many) capability which aligns with your requirements perfectly.</p>

<li>MongoDB stores data in a document structure (BSON format)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support SQL Queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apache Cassandra uses Cassandra Query Language (CQL)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The correct answer is B. PostgreSQL.</p>
<p><strong>Azure Cosmos DB's API for PostgreSQL provides full support for SQL queries, geo-replication, and allows you to store and access data relationally.</strong></p>
<p>It offers automatic and instant scalability, global distribution, and effortless replication of data across Azure regions, fulfilling all of your mentioned requirements</p>
<p>A. Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database that does not natively support SQL queries. While it does offer some SQL-like capabilities, it is not a fully
relational database.</p>
<p>C. MongoDB is a NoSQL database and does not support the relational data model, although it does provide SQL-like query language.</p>
<p>D. NoSQL is a type of database design that can store and retrieve data, but it isn't a specific API. Also, not all NoSQL databases support SQL queries and relational data storage</p>
<p>B. <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>:  Azure Cosmos DB provides support for multiple APIs, each tailored to different data models and query languages. The PostgreSQL API is well-suited for applications that require relational data storage and the ability to execute SQL queries. It offers compatibility with the PostgreSQL wire protocol and supports standard SQL syntax, allowing you to leverage your existing SQL skills and tools</p>

<p><strong>You plan to stream the events to an Azure event hub and use Event Hubs Capture to implement cold path processing of the events. The output of Event Hubs Capture will be consumed by a reporting system.</strong></p>
<p>You need to identify which type of Azure storage must be provisioned to support Event Hubs Capture, and which inbound data format the reporting
system must support.</p>
<p>What should you identify? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_47.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Storage Type: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2</strong>    ✅</p>
<p><strong>Azure Event Hubs Capture allows captured data to be written either to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2</strong>. Given the nature of the data and its use in reporting and analysis, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is the more appropriate choice because it is designed for big data analytics</p>
<p><strong>2. Data format: Avro</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>Event Hubs Capture uses Avro format for the data it captures. Avro is a row-oriented format that is suitable for various data types, it's compact, fast, binary, and enables efficient and fast serialization of data. This makes it a good choice for Event Hubs Capture.</p>

<p><strong>Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB creates a tight integration between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics, allowing you to run near real-time analytics over operational data in Azure Cosmos DB</strong>. It creates a "no-ETL" (Extract, Transform, Load) environment that allows you to
analyze data directly without affecting the performance of the transactional workload, which is exactly what is required in this scenario.</p>
<p>A. Azure Data Factory with Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics connectors would require ETL operations which might impact the
performance of the operational data store.</p>
<p>B. Azure Synapse Analytics with PolyBase data loading is more appropriate for loading data from external data sources such as Azure Blob Storage
or Azure Data Lake Storage.</p>
<p>D. Azure Cosmos DB change feed doesn't directly address the need for analytics without affecting the performance of the operational data store.</p>

<p>Your company identifies the following business continuity and disaster recovery objectives for virtual machines that host sales, finance, and reporting applications in the company's on-premises data center:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ The sales application <strong>must be able to fail over to a second on-premises data center.</strong> </li>
<li>✑ T<strong>he reporting application must be able to recover point-in-time data at a daily granularity. The RTO is eight hours.</strong> </li>
<li>✑ <strong>The finance application requires that data be retained for seven years</strong>. In the event of a disaster, the application must be able to run from Azure. The recovery time objective (RTO) is 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to recommend which services meet the business continuity and disaster recovery objectives. <strong>The solution must minimize costs</strong>. What should you recommend for each application? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct applications. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content</p>

<p><strong>Box 1: Azure Site Recovery -</strong>  ✅</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinates virtual-machine and physical-server replication, failover, and fullback. </li>
<li>DR solutions have low Recovery point objectives; </li>
<li>DR copy can be behind by a few seconds/minutes. DR needs only operational recovery data, which can take hours to a day. </li>
<li>Using DR data for long-term retention is not recommended because of the fine-grained data capture. </li>
<li>Disaster recovery solutions have smaller Recovery time objectives because they are more in sync with the source. </li>
<li>Remote monitor the health of machines and create customizable recovery plans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Box 2: Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>Backup ensures that your data is safe and recoverable while Site Recovery keeps your workloads available when/if an outage occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Box 3: Azure Backup only</strong></p>
<p>Azure Backup - </p>
<ul>
<li>Backs up data on-premises and in the cloud</li>
<li>Have wide variability in their acceptable Recovery point objective. VM backups usually one day while database backups as low as 15 minutes. Backup data is typically retained for 30 days or less. From a compliance view, data may need to be saved for years. Backup data is ideal for archiving in such instances. </li>
<li>
<p>Because of a larger Recovery point objective, the amount of data a backup solution needs to process is usually much higher, which leads to a longer Recovery time objective.</p>

<p>You need to design a highly available Azure SQL database that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Failover between replicas of the database must occur without any data loss. </li>
<li>✑ The database must remain available in the event of a <strong>zone outage</strong>. </li>
<li>✑ Costs must be minimized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which deployment option should you use?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Azure SQL Managed Instance Business Critical </li>
<li><strong>B. Azure SQL Database Premium</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>C. Azure SQL Database Basic </li>
<li>D. Azure SQL Managed Instance General Purpose</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zone-redundant configuration is not available in SQL Managed Instance</strong>. In SQL Database this feature is only available when the Gen5 hardware is selected.</p>
<p><strong>To prevent Data Loss, Premium/Business Critical</strong> is required:</p>
<p>The primary node constantly pushes changes to the secondary nodes in order and ensures that the data is persisted to at least one secondary replica before committing each transaction. This process guarantees that if the primary node crashes for any reason, there is always a fully synchronized node to fail over to.</p>
<p><strong>B is the correct answer.</strong></p>
<p>Zone-redundant is currently in preview for SQL Managed Instance, and is only available for the Business Critical service tier.</p>
<p>D - SQL Managed Instance General Purpose does not support Zone-redundant as of now. So it is out of the question.</p>

<p><strong>A. Adding a secondary replica to AG1</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>Reason: Creating an Always On availability group on VM1 would not be necessary, as you already have an availability group (AG1) in place on your on-premises SQL Server instances</p>
<p><strong>By adding a secondary replica to AG1, you can provide a copy of DB1 that can be used for the migration.</strong> This will allow you to minimize downtime on DB1 by performing the migration on the secondary replica, while the primary replica remains available for use.</p>

<p><strong>1. Service tier and compute tier?</strong>  : <strong>b. General Purpose service tier and serverless compute tier</strong>  ✅</p>
<p><strong>The General Purpose service tier with serverless compute tier provides a cost-effective solution that meets the requirements.</strong></p>
<p>General Purpose tier supports zone-redundant configurations, which can maintain availability in the event of a single datacenter outage. The serverless compute tier automatically scales up or down based on workload, which is ideal for handling the increased load during payroll operations. </p>
<p><strong>2. Encryption method?</strong>  : <strong>a. Always Encrypted</strong>  ✅</p>
<p><strong>Always Encrypted is the recommended encryption method for this scenario because it allows you to encrypt specific columns that contain PII.</strong> </p>
<p>This ensures that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, providing a higher level of security for PII. </p>
<p>Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database at rest but does not provide column-level encryption, and Microsoft SQL Server and database encryption keys would involve additional manual configuration and management of keys.</p>

<li><strong>C. Implement Geo-redundant backup</strong>.   ✅</li>
<li>D. Configure native MySQL replication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Implement Geo-redundant backup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geo-redundant backup (GRB) feature in Azure Database for MySQL allows automatic backups to be stored in a different geographic region (geography).</strong> </p>
<p>In the event of a region-wide service disruption, you can restore the database from the geo-redundant backup, which helps minimize downtime. Other options do not provide business continuity in case of regional failures.</p>
<p><strong>Option A, creating a read replica, primarily helps with read-heavy workloads and not for disaster recovery.</strong> </p>
<p>Option B, storing the database files in Azure premium file shares, might <strong>improve performance but does not specifically provide a disaster recovery solution</strong>.</p>
<p>Option D, configuring native MySQL replication, isn't supported directly within Azure Database for MySQL. Instead, you would use Azure's built-in business continuity features, such as Geo-redundant backup.</p>

<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_78.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - <strong>Because we are using an APIM, deployed to a VNET but configured to be "External"</strong> </li>
<li>Yes - <strong>Because the APIM is deployed in the same vNET as VM1 just in a different subnet.</strong> Communication between subnets are enabled by default and there is no mention of otherwise. </li>
<li>No - <strong>VPN required because the APIM is accessible from the internet by virtue of it being configured as "External"</strong></li>

<p><strong>Box 1: Azure Application Gateway</strong>  ✅</p>
<p><strong>The Azure Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection for web applications.</strong> These protections are provided by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS). </p>
<p><strong>Box 2: Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>   ✅</p>
<h4 id="question-9_3">Question 9</h4>
<p>You are designing a microservices architecture that will be hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Apps that will consume the microservices will be hosted on Azure virtual machines. The virtual machines and the AKS cluster will reside on the same virtual network. </p>
<p>You need to design a solution to expose the microservices to the consumer apps. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Ingress access to the microservices must be restricted to a single private IP address and protected by using mutual TLS authentication. </li>
<li>✑ <strong>The number of incoming microservice calls must be rate-limited</strong>. </li>
<li>✑ Costs must be minimized.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the solution?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Azure App Gateway with Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) </li>
<li>B. Azure API Management Standard tier with a service endpoint </li>
<li>C. Azure Front Door with Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) </li>
<li><strong>D. Azure API Management Premium tier with virtual network connection</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong> </p>
<p>One option is to deploy APIM (API Management) inside the cluster VNet. </p>
<p>The AKS cluster and the applications that consume the microservices might reside within the same VNet, hence there is no reason to expose the cluster publicly as all API traffic will remain within the VNet. For these scenarios, you can deploy API Management into the cluster VNet. API Management Premium tier supports</p>
<p>The best option to meet the requirements you mentioned would be to use Azure API Management with a virtual network connection. This can be achieved with the Premium tier of Azure API Management. This will allow you to restrict ingress access to a single private IP address and protect it using mutual TLS authentication. <strong>Additionally, Azure API Management provides rate limiting capabilities and can be deployed within a virtual network to minimize costs.</strong> So, the correct answer is</p>
<p><strong>D. Azure API Management Premium tier with virtual network connection.</strong>  ✅</p>

<li>✑ Writes to the Application event log. </li>
</ul>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to host Service1 in Azure. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize maintenance overhead. </li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. an Azure App Service web app</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>B. an Azure virtual machine scale set </li>
<li>C. an App Service Environment (ASE) </li>
<li>D. an Azure Functions app</li>

<p><strong>Azure Web App meets the requirements and is less expansive compared to VM scale sets.</strong></p>
<h4 id="question-11_3">Question 11</h4>
<p>You have a .NET web service named Service1 that performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ <strong>Reads and writes temporary files to the local file system.</strong> </li>
<li>✑ Writes to the Application event log. </li>
</ul>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to host Service1 in Azure. The solution must meet the following requirements: </p>
<ul>

<li>B. an Azure virtual machine scale set </li>
<li>C. an App Service Environment (ASE) </li>
<li>D. an Azure Functions app</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. </p>
<p>By hosting Service1 as an Azure App Service web app, you can minimize maintenance overhead, as the platform takes care of the underlying infrastructure, patching, and scaling. </p>
<p><strong>Azure App Service also offers a cost-effective solution that can be scaled up or out as needed to meet the demands of your application</strong>.</p>
<p>While Azure Functions, virtual machine scale sets, and App Service Environments can also host web services, they may not provide the same balance of minimal maintenance overhead and cost-effectiveness as Azure App Service web apps do in this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="question-11_4">Question 11</h4>
<p>You have the Azure resources shown in the following table</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_80.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p>You need to deploy a new Azure Firewall policy that will contain mandatory rules for all Azure Firewall deployments. </p>
<p><strong>The new policy will be configured as a parent policy for the existing policies</strong>. </p>
<p>What is the <strong>minimum number of additional Azure Firewall policies</strong> you should create?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. 0 </li>
<li>B. 1 </li>
<li>C. 2 </li>
<li>
<p><strong>D. 3</strong>  ✅</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firewall policies work across regions and subscriptions</strong>. </li>
<li>Place all your global configurations in the parent policy. </li>
<li><strong>The parent policy is required to be in the same region as the child policy.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Each of the three regions must have a new parent policy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parent policy must be in the same region as child policy!</strong></p>
<p>You get this information when creating a Firewall Policy. <strong>Parent Policy drop down list only shows policies in the same region.</strong></p>
<p>Existing Firewall Policies are located in different regions. To link them to a new parent policy, each region must have a new parent policy =&gt; 3 new policies.</p>
<p>Azure Firewall Policies can be used across regions. For example, you can create a policy in West US, and use it in East US.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: You can't set a Parent Policy from different region to a child in a given region</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore we need 3 different region policies to be set as parents if we do not change the child's regions</strong>.</p>

<p>Your company has an app named App1 that uses data from the on-premises Microsoft SQL Server databases shown in the following table.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_81.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p>App1 and the data are used on the first day of the month only. </p>
<p><strong>The data is not expected to grow more than 3 percent each year.</strong></p>
<p>The company is rewriting App1 as an Azure web app and plans to migrate all the data to Azure</p>
<p>You need to migrate the data to Azure SQL Database and ensure that the database is only available on the first day of each month. Which service tier should you use?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. vCore-based General Purpose</strong>   ✅</li>
<li>B. DTU-based Standard </li>
<li>C. vCore-based Business Critical </li>
<li>D. DTU-based Basic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Note: App1 and the data are used on the first day of the month only. </p>
<p><strong>See Serverless compute tier below. The vCore based purchasing model.</strong></p>
<p>The term vCore refers to the Virtual Core. </p>
<p>In this purchasing model of Azure SQL Database, you can choose from the provisioned compute tier and serverless compute tier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provisioned compute tier: You choose the exact compute resources for the workload. </li>
<li>Serverless compute tier: Azure automatically pauses and resumes the database based on workload activity in the serverless tier. During the pause period, Azure does not charge you for the compute resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use the serverless model in vcore</strong></p>
<p>While the provisioned compute tier provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, the serverless compute tier auto-scales compute resources based on workload activity.</p>
<p>While the provisioned compute tier bills for the amount of compute provisioned at a fixed price per hour, the serverless compute tier bills for the amount of compute used, per second.</p>

<ul>
<li>A. Yes </li>
<li><strong>B. No</strong>   ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer.</strong> This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions. </p>
<p><strong>Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness. It does not provide rate limiting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: Azure Front Door would meet the requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) rate limit rule for Azure Front Door controls the number of requests allowed from clients during a one-minute duration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Azure Traffic Manager does not have rate limit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use Azure Front Door with WAF</strong></p>
<p><strong>To achieve rate limiting along with load balancing and high availability, you should use Azure Front Door with the Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>.</p>
<p>Azure Front Door is a global, scalable entry-point that uses the Microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications. It provides load balancing and failover across multiple regions.</p>
<p>By enabling the WAF on Azure Front Door, you can configure custom rate limiting rules to protect your web app from excessive traffic and potential attacks.</p>
<h4 id="question-18_3">Question 18</h4>
<p><strong>Solution: You use Azure Load Balancer to provide access to the app.</strong></p>
<p>Does this meet the goal?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Yes </li>
<li><strong>B. No</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: B Azure Application Gateway and Azure Load Balancer do not support rate or connection limits.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Box 1: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong> ✅</p>
<p>An on-premises network gateway can exchange routes with an Azure virtual network gateway using the border gateway protocol (BGP). </p>
<p>Using BGP with an Azure virtual network gateway is dependent on the type you selected when you created the gateway. </p>
<p>If the type you selected were: <strong>ExpressRoute: You must use BGP to advertise on-premises routes to the Microsoft Edge router. You cannot create user-defined routes to force traffic to the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway if you deploy a virtual network gateway deployed as type: ExpressRoute</strong>. </p>
<p>You can use user-defined routes for forcing traffic from the Express Route to, for example, a Network Virtual Appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Box 2: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong> ✅</p>
<p>Layer 3 connectivity Microsoft uses BGP, <strong>an industry standard dynamic routing protocol, to exchange routes between your on-premises network, your instances in Azure, and Microsoft public addresses</strong>. </p>
<p>We establish multiple BGP sessions with your network for different traffic profiles. More details can be found in the ExpressRoute circuit and routing domains article.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Routing from the virtual networks to the on-premises location must be configured by using: <strong>b. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) To configure routing between the Azure virtual networks and the on-premises locations, you should use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong>. BGP is a dynamic routing protocol that enables automatic route updates between ExpressRoute circuits and the on-premises sites. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The automatic routing configuration following a failover must be handled by using: a. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>BGP can also handle automatic routing configuration in the event of a failover.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>It can dynamically detect when a site fails and automatically reroute traffic to the other available site.</strong> This ensures that traffic from the workloads on the virtual networks to the internet is rerouted to the other on- premises site if one site fails.</p>

<li>D. Azure Data Box Gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>What are mapping data flows? </p>
<p>Mapping data flows are visually designed data transformations in Azure Data Factory. </p>
<p>Data flows allow data engineers to develop data transformation logic without writing code. </p>
<p><strong>The resulting data flows are executed as activities within Azure Data Factory pipelines that use scaled out Apache Spark clusters</strong>. </p>
<p>Data flow activities can be operationalized using existing Azure Data Factory scheduling, control, flow, and monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Azure Data Factory</strong> is a cloud-based data <strong>integration service</strong> that allows you to create, schedule, and <strong>manage data pipelines that can move and transform data across different sources and destinations, including Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Azure Databricks</strong> is a <strong>cloud-based analytics platform</strong> that allows you to process large amounts of data using <strong>Apache Spark</strong>. It can also be used for data transformation and ETL, but it requires more technical expertise and development effort than using Azure Data Factory mapping data flows. </p>
<p><strong>Azure Storage Sync</strong> is a service that allows you to <strong>sync on-premises file servers with Azure file shares, but it does not support data transformation</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Azure Data Box Gateway</strong> is a hardware device that allows you to transfer large amounts of data to Azure, but it does not support data transformation using mapping data flow.</p>
<h4 id="question-26_2">Question 26</h4>
<p>You have an Azure subscription. You need to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) solution that will use Windows Server 2019 nodes. </p>
<p>The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Minimize the time it takes to provision compute resources during scale-out operations. </li>
<li>✑ Support autoscaling of Windows Server containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which scaling option should you recommend?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Kubernetes version 1.20.2 or newer </li>
<li>B. Virtual nodes with Virtual Kubelet ACI </li>
<li><strong>C. cluster autoscaler</strong>   ✅</li>
<li>D. horizontal pod autoscaler</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct Answer: C</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster autoscaler help provision new nodes (compute ressources)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster autoscaler works on top of horizontal pod autoscaler.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deployments can scale across AKS with no delay as cluster autoscaler deploys new nodes in your AKS cluster.</p>
<p>Note: AKS clusters can scale in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cluster autoscaler watches for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. </li>
<li>The horizontal pod autoscaler uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p>Not D: If your application needs to rapidly scale, the horizontal pod autoscaler may schedule more pods than can be provided by the existing compute resources in the node pool. </p>
<p>If configured, this scenario would then trigger the cluster autoscaler to deploy additional nodes in the node pool, <strong>but it may take a few minutes for those nodes to successfully provision and allow the Kubernetes scheduler to run pods on them</strong>.</p>

<p>You add a new data factory.</p>
<p>What should you do next? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_87.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: Install a self-hosted integration runtime.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your data store is located inside an on-premises network, an Azure virtual network, or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, you need to configure a self-hosted integration runtime to connect to it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Integration Runtime to be used to connect to the data store.</strong> You can use Azure Integration Runtime or Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Box 2: Create a pipeline.</strong></p>
<p>You perform the Copy activity with a pipeline.</p>
<p>You must install the Data Factory self-hosted integration runtime on a Windows VM in your Azure virtual network.</p>
<p><strong>A Data Factory or Synapse Workspace can have one or more pipelines. A pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that together perform a task.</strong> </p>
<p>For example, a pipeline could contain a set of activities that ingest and clean log data, and then kick off a mapping data flow to analyze the log data.</p>
<p><strong>1. From Server1: b. Install a self-hosted integration runtime</strong>   ✅</p>
<p>A self-hosted integration runtime needs to be installed on Server1 to enable secure communication between the on-premises network and Azure Data Factory. This runtime allows Data Factory to access and copy data from the on-premises file server to Azure Storage.</p>
<p><strong>2. From the data factory: a. Create a pipeline</strong>   ✅</p>
<p><strong>In the Azure Data Factory, create a pipeline that specifies the source (on-premises file server) and destination (Azure Storage)</strong>. </p>
<p>The pipeline will use the self-hosted integration runtime to establish a connection to the on-premises file server and transfer the data to Azure Storage</p>

<li>A. horizontal pod autoscaler </li>
<li>B. cluster autoscaler </li>
<li><strong>C. virtual nodes</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>D. Virtual Kubelet</li>
</ul>
<p>To rapidly scale application workloads in an AKS cluster, you can use virtual nodes. With virtual nodes, you have quick provisioning of pods, and only pay per second for their execution time. </p>
<p>You don't need to wait for Kubernetes cluster autoscaler to deploy VM compute nodes to run the additional pods. <strong>Virtual nodes are only supported with Linux pods and nodes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cluster autoscaler for windows</strong>  ✅</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Nodes for Linux</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>C. virtual nodes To meet the requirements of minimizing the time it takes to provision compute resources during scale-out operations, supporting autoscaling of Linux containers, and minimizing administrative effort, you should recommend virtual nodes for the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) solution with Linux nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual nodes allow you to scale your AKS cluster quickly by offloading the additional compute resources to Azure Container Instances (ACI).</strong> </p>
<p>This reduces the time it takes to provision resources during scale-out operations, as the resources can be provisioned instantly without having to wait for a new node to be created. Additionally, virtual nodes support autoscaling of Linux containers and require minimal administrative effort compared to other scaling options</p>

<h4 id="question-46_1">Question 46</h4>
<p>You are designing a software as a service (SaaS) application that will enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users to create and publish online surveys. The SaaS application will have a front-end web app and a back-end web API. The web app will rely on the web API to handle updates to customer surveys</p>
<p>You need to design an authorization ow for the SaaS application. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ <strong>To access the back-end web API, the web app must authenticate by using OAuth 2 bearer tokens.</strong></li>
<li>✑ The web app must authenticate by using the identities of individual users</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the solution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_95.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: Azure AD -</strong></p>
<p>The Azure AD server issues tokens (access &amp; refresh token). See step 5 below in graphic.</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth 2.0 authentication with Azure Active Directory.</li>
<li>The OAuth 2.0 is the industry protocol for authorization. It allows a user to grant limited access to its protected resources. Designed to work</li>
<li>specically with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth separates the role of the client from the resource owner.</li>
<li>The client requests access to the resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server (here the Azure AD server).</li>
<li>The resource server issues access tokens with the approval of the resource owner. </li>
<li>The client uses the access tokens to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_96.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 2: A web API -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delegated access is used.</li>
<li>The bearer token sent to the web API contains the user identity.</li>
<li><strong>The web API makes authorization decisions based on the user identity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. The access tokens will be generated by: a. Azure AD</strong></p>
<p>Azure AD is the identity provider and is responsible for generating access tokens in an OAuth 2.0 flow. The web app will authenticate with Azure
AD and receive an access token.</p>
<p><strong>2. Authorization decisions will be performed by: c. a web API</strong></p>
<p>The web API, as the resource server in the OAuth 2.0 flow, is responsible for making authorization decisions. It validates the access token it receives from the web app and determines what resources the authenticated user can access.</p>

<p>You are designing a virtual machine that will <strong>run Microsoft SQL Server and contain two data disks. The first data disk will store log miles, and the second data disk will store data. Both disks are P40 managed disks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You need to recommend a host caching method for each disk</strong>. The method must provide the best overall performance for the virtual machine
while preserving the integrity of the SQL data and logs.</p>
<p>Which host caching method should you recommend for each disk? To answer, drag the appropriate methods to the correct disks. Each method

<p>Your storage caching policy varies depending on the type of SQL Server data files that are hosted on the drive.</p>
<p><strong>Box 2: ReadOnly -</strong></p>
<p>Guidelines to optimize performance for your SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set host caching to read-only for data file disks.</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set host caching to none for log file disks</strong>.</p>

<li>[x] <strong>E. Enable parallel task execution on compute nodes.</strong>.   ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Multi-instance tasks allow you to run an Azure Batch task on multiple compute nodes simultaneously. <strong>These tasks enable high performance computing scenarios like Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications in Batch.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You configure compute nodes for parallel task execution at the pool level.</li>
<li>Azure Batch allows you to set task slots per node up to (4x) the number of node cores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure Batch is designed for high-performance parallel computing. It's a cloud-based job scheduling service that parallelizes the processing of large
volumes of data across many virtual machines. It allows for each node to communicate data to every other node, which is a requirement in the
question</p>
<p>Parallel task execution enables concurrent processing of multiple tasks on a single compute node, thereby maximizing the number of nodes to
calculate multiple scenes as fast as possible. This can help to speed up processing times.</p>

<p>Azure SQL Database Serverless meets the requirements and <strong>is less expensive than Azure SQL Database Business Critical</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: General Purpose service tier zone redundant availability</p>
<p>Zone-redundant configuration for the general purpose service tier is offered for both serverless and provisioned compute to replicate databases across multiple physical locations within an Azure region</p>
<p>This configuration utilizes Azure Availability Zones By selecting zone-redundancy, you can make your new and existing serverless and provisioned generalג purpose single databases and elastic pools resilient to a much larger set of failures, including catastrophic datacenter outages, without any changes of the application logic.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not A, not B: Zone-redundant configuration is not available in SQL Managed Instance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not C: Azure SQL Database Business Critical is more expensive than Azure SQL Database Serverless.</strong></p>
<p>Note: Premium and Business Critical service tiers use the Premium availability model, which integrates compute resources (sqlservr.exe

<li>[ ] C. KeyVault1 only</li>
<li>[x] <strong>D. the same geography only</strong>   ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the backup and restore commands has two limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can't back up a key vault in one geography and restore it into another geography</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The backup command backs up all versions of each secret</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<p><strong>Not A: Azure Key Vault does not allow you to move a key vault from one region to another</strong>. </p>
<p>You can, however, <strong>create a key vault in the new region, manually copy each individual key, secret, or certificate from your existing key vault to the new key vault, and then remove the original key vault.</strong></p>
<p>When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate, the backup operation will download the object as an encrypted blob. </p>
<p>This blob can't be decrypted outside of Azure. To get usable data from this blob, you must restore the blob into a key vault within the same Azure subscription and Azure geography</p>

<p>You have an on-premises line-of-business (LOB) application that uses a Microsoft SQL Server instance as the backend.</p>
<p>You plan to migrate the on-premises SQL Server instance to Azure virtual machines.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a highly available SQL Server deployment that meets the following requirements:</p>
<p><strong>Minimizes costs</strong></p>
<p>Minimizes failover time if a single server fails</p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A. an Always On availability group that has premium storage disks and a virtual network name (VNN)</li>
<li>[ ] B. an Always On Failover Cluster Instance that has a virtual network name (VNN) and a standard file share</li>
<li>[X] C. <strong>an Always On availability group that has premium storage disks and a distributed network name (DNN)</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>[ ] D. an Always On Failover Cluster Instance that has a virtual network name (VNN) and a premium file share</li>
</ul>
<p>Always On availability groups on Azure Virtual Machines are similar to Always On availability groups on-premises, and rely on the underlying
Windows Server Failover Cluster.</p>
<p>If you deploy your SQL Server VMs to a single subnet, you can configure a virtual network name (VNN) and an Azure Load Balancer, or a
distributed network name (DNN) to route traffic to your availability group listener.</p>
<p>There are some behavior differences between the functionality of the VNN listener and DNN listener that are important to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failover time: Failover time is faster when using a DNN listener since there is no need to wait for the network load balancer to detect the
failure event and change its routing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p>C. an Always On availability group that has premium storage disks and a distributed network name (DNN).</p>
<p><strong>The Always On Availability Group with a Distributed Network Name (DNN) would be the better choice due to the faster failover time, which aligns with the requirement of minimizing failover time if a single server fails.</strong></p>
<p>The DNN listener in this case doesn't require an Azure Load Balancer to reroute traffic, resulting in quicker failovers compared to the VNN listener.
This is a great choice when high availability and minimal failover time are prioritized</p>

<p>Your company plans to deploy various Azure App Service instances that will use Azure SQL databases. The App Service instances will be deployed at the same time as the Azure SQL databases.</p>
<p>The company has a regulatory requirement to deploy the App Service instances only to specific Azure regions. The resources for the App Service instances must reside in the same region.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to meet the regulatory requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: You recommend creating resource groups based on locations and implementing resource locks on the resource groups.</strong></p>
<p>Does this meet the goal?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A. Yes</li>
<li>[X] B. <strong>No</strong>  ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should recommend using an Azure Policy initiative to enforce the location</strong></p>
<p>Note: Azure Resource Policy Definitions can be used which can be applied to a specific Resource Group with the App Service instances.
In Azure Policy, we offer several built-in policies that are available by default. For example</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed Locations (Deny): Restricts the available locations for new resources. Its effect is used to enforce your geo-compliance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. No</strong></p>
<p>While creating resource groups based on locations can help organize resources, it does not inherently limit the regions where resources can be
deployed. </p>
<p><strong>Resource locks protect resources from accidental deletion or modification, but they do not restrict where resources can be created</strong>. For
enforcing location restrictions, Azure Policy with location-based policies would be a better option. These policies can be used to ensure resources
are only created in specified locations.</p>
<p>As an administrator, you can lock an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource to protect them from accidental user deletions and
modifications. The lock overrides any user permissions.</p>
<p>You can set locks that prevent either deletions or modifications. In the portal, these locks are called Delete and Read-only. In the command line,
these locks are called CanNotDelete and ReadOnly.</p>
<ul>
<li>CanNotDelete means authorized users can read and modify a resource, but they can't delete it.</li>
<li>ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update it. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions that the Reader role provides</li>

<li>[X] <strong>B. Premium SKU Azure Container Registry</strong> </li>
<li>[ ] C. Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
<li>[ ] D. Azure Cache for Redis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enable geo-replication for container images.</strong></p>
<p>Best practice: <strong>Store your container images in Azure Container Registry and geo-replicate the registry to each AKS region.</strong></p>
<p>To deploy and run your applications in AKS, you need a way to store and pull the container images. Container Registry integrates with AKS, so it can securely store your container images or Helm charts. Container Registry supports multimaster geo-replication to automatically replicate your images to Azure regions around the world.</p>
<p>Geo-replication is a feature of Premium SKU container registries.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p>When you use Container Registry geo-replication to pull images from the same region, the results are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster: You pull images from high-speed, low-latency network connections within the same Azure region.</li>
<li>More reliable: If a region is unavailable, your AKS cluster pulls the images from an available container registry.</li>
<li>Cheaper: There's no network egress charge between datacenters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Geo-Replication is a premium SKU container registry feature.</strong></p>
<p>Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service used for storing private Docker container images. It's tightly integrated with Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) and provides streamlined Docker image builds, storage, and retrieval.</p>
<p>The premium SKU of Azure Container Registry supports several advanced features, including the geo-replication of registries. Geo-replication
enables an Azure container registry to function as a single registry, serving multiple regions with multi-master regional registries. This means that

<ul>
<li>[ ] A. shared access signatures (SAS) and Conditional Access policies</li>
<li>[ ] B. certificates and Azure Key Vault</li>
<li>[ ] C. master keys and Azure Information Protection policies</li>
<li>[x] <strong>D. a resource token and an Access control (IAM) role assignment</strong>  ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal is used to configure role-based access control on Azure Cosmos resources.</strong></p>
<p>The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in roles or custom roles for individuals and groups. The following screenshot shows Active Directory integration (RBAC) using access control (IAM) in the Azure portal:</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_100.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p>Note: To use the Azure Cosmos DB RBAC in your application, you have to update the way you initialize the Azure Cosmos DB SDK. Instead of
passing your account's primary key, you have to pass an instance of a TokenCredential class. This instance provides the Azure Cosmos DB SDK
with the context required to fetch an Azure AD (AAD) token on behalf of the identity you wish to use.</p>
<p><strong>Azure Cosmos DB's SQL API provides two types of authorization: master key token and resource token.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Master key tokens provide access to the all
data and all permissions. </li>
<li>Resource tokens provide access to specific containers and permissions, and you can create these tokens with an Azure AD user's identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide Azure AD users with access to the Azure Cosmos DB, you would assign them a specific IAM role. Azure Cosmos DB uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) for providing specific access. Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of resources in Azure.</p>
<p>The combination of a resource token and an IAM role assignment would provide the necessary access control for the Azure AD user accounts to have read access to the Cosmos DB databases.</p>

<p>You manage a database environment for a Microsoft Volume Licensing customer named Contoso, Ltd. Contoso uses License Mobility through Software
Assurance.</p>
<p>You need to deploy 50 databases. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Support automatic scaling.</li>
<li>✑ Minimize Microsoft SQL Server licensing costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you include in the solution? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_101.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: vCore -</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>You can only apply the Azure Hybrid licensing model when you choose a vCore-based purchasing model and the provisioned compute tier for
your Azure SQL Database. Azure Hybrid Benefit isn't available for service tiers under the DTU-based purchasing model or for the serverless compute tier.</p>
<p><strong>Box 2: An Azure SQL Database elastic pool</strong>  ✅</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and
unpredictable usage demands. The databases in an elastic pool are on a single server and share a set number of resources at a set price.
Elastic pools in SQL Database enable software as a service (SaaS) developers to optimize the price performance for a group of databases
within a prescribed budget while delivering performance elasticity for each database.</p>
<p>VCore - With the provisioned compute, you can choose the amount of compute resources that are always provisioned for your workload. With the
serverless compute you can specify the autoscaling of the compute resources over a configurable compute range.</p>

<p>You have an on-premises application named App1 that uses an Oracle database.</p>
<p>You plan to use Azure Databricks to transform and load data from App1 to an Azure Synapse Analytics instance.</p>
<p><strong>You need to ensure that the App1 data is available to Databricks</strong>.</p>
<p>Which two Azure services should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A. Azure Data Box Gateway</li>
<li>[ ] B. Azure Import/Export service</li>
<li>[x] C. <strong>Azure Data Lake Storage</strong>.  ✅</li>
<li>[ ] D. Azure Data Box Edge</li>
<li>[X] E. <strong>Azure Data Factory</strong>.   ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The correct answer should be C and E</strong></p>
<p><strong>ADF moves data from on-prem Oracle to Data Lake storage, which makes data ready for DataBrick</strong></p>
<p><strong>DataBricks "ETL" data to Synapse:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADF - to extract and load data to Data Lake</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data Lake - as it's the only storage generally supported by Databricks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Azure Data Lake Storage is a secure, scalable and reliable data lake that allows you to perform analytics on large amounts of data. It's a great
choice for storing large volumes of data, like what App1 might produce</p>
<p>Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for moving and transforming data at
scale. In this case, it can be used to create a pipeline to move the data from your on-premises Oracle database to Azure Data Lake Storage, making
it available for further processing with Azure Databricks. Azure Data Factory has built-in support for a wide range of data sources, including Oracle</p>

<p>The Business Critical service tier is designed for OLTP applications with high transaction rates and low latency I/O requirements. It offers the highest resilience to failures by using several isolated replicas.</p>
<p>B is wrong because Azure SQL Managed Instance General Purpose does not support Zone redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>C. Azure SQL Database Business Critical</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Business Critical service tier is designed for applications that require low-latency responses and high transaction rates, and need the highest degree of resilience to failures.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Virtual WAN meets the first 3 requirements, and the secured virtual hub has the Azure Firewall Manager, which can do the FQDN filtering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option A, Azure Virtual WAN with a secured virtual hub</strong>, </p>
<p>is the best recommendation for this scenario as it allows for automatic connection of mobile users to the closest Azure region, connection of offices to their local Azure region via ExpressRoute circuits, support for transitive routing, and filtering of network traffic between virtual networks by using FQDNs.</p>
<p>Option B, virtual network peering and application security groups, <strong>does not provide automatic connection of mobile users to the closest Azure region or support for transitive routing</strong></p>
<p>Option C, virtual network gateways and network security groups (NSGs), <strong>does not provide automatic connection of mobile users to the closest Azure region or support for transitive routing, and filtering network traffic between virtual networks by using FQDNs is more challenging.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Azure Service Bus sessions enable joint and ordered handling of unbounded sequences of related messages.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Sessions can be used in first in, first out (FIFO) and request-response patterns.</strong> This article shows how to use sessions to implement these patterns when using Service Bus.</p>
<p>Azure Service Bus supports a FIFO pattern through the use of sessions. A session is a sequence of ordered messages. All messages in a session are handled in the order they arrive. This ensures that messages are processed in the order they were added to the queue. </p>
<p>Options A and D are incorrect because Azure Storage queues do not natively support the First In, First Out (FIFO) pattern. <strong>There are no such features as custom metadata setting or stored access policy that can establish FIFO in Azure Storage queues</strong>. </p>
<p>Option B is incorrect because while <strong>partitioning in Azure Service Bus can improve performance by spreading the load across multiple message brokers and stores, it doesn't enforce FIFO ordering across partitions</strong>. </p>
<p>FIFO ordering is maintained within a partition, but not across partitions. Hence, for strict FIFO, you would not want to enable partitioning, you would want to use sessions</p>

<p>You have an Azure Functions microservice app named App1 that is hosted in the Consumption plan. App1 uses an Azure Queue Storage trigger.</p>
<p>You plan to migrate App1 to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster</p>
<p>You need to prepare the AKS cluster to support App1. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the same scaling mechanism as the current deployment.</li>
<li>Support kubenet and Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) networking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
<p>NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.</p>
<ul>
<li>[X] <strong>A. Configure the horizontal pod autoscaler.</strong> ✅</li>
<li>[ ] B. Install Virtual Kubelet.</li>
<li>[ ] C. Configure the AKS cluster autoscaler.</li>
<li>[ ] D. Configure the virtual node add-on.</li>
<li>[x] <strong>E. Install Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kubernetes uses the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to monitor the resource demand and automatically scale the number of replicas</strong>. By default, the horizontal pod autoscaler checks the Metrics API every 15 seconds for any required changes in replica count, but the Metrics API retrieves data
from the Kubelet every 60 seconds. Effectively, the HPA is updated every 60 seconds. When changes are required, the number of replicas is
increased or decreased accordingly. Horizontal pod autoscaler works with AKS clusters that have deployed the Metrics Server for Kubernetes 1.8</p>
<p>Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple
and is a CNCF Incubation project.</p>
<p>It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.</p>
<h4 id="question-84">Question 84</h4>
<p><strong>You need to recommend a solution to enable the cloud services to asynchronously communicate transaction information by using XML messages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Azure Queue Storage</strong>   ✅</p>
<p>A. Azure Service Fabric: <strong>It's a distributed systems platform for deploying and managing microservices and containers</strong>. While it can be used to build resilient applications, it's not a messaging system per se.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Azure Traffic Manager: It's a DNS-based traffic load balancer. It doesn't deal with asynchronous messaging.</strong></p>
<p>C. <strong>Azure Queue Storage: This service allows you to decouple cloud components and ensure asynchronous message delivery.</strong> Messages can be
placed into a queue, where another service can pick them up and process them, which is exactly what's described in the scenario. The messages
can be in XML format or any other format that suits your needs.</p>
<p>D. <strong>Azure Notification Hubs: This is for sending push notifications to mobile devices. It's not designed for inter-service communication.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, the correct Answer is:</p>
<p><strong>C. Azure Queue Storage.</strong></p>

<h4 id="question-86">Question 86</h4>
<p>You are developing a multi-tier app named App1 that will be hosted on Azure virtual machines. The peak utilization periods for App1 will be from 8
AM to 9 AM and 4 PM to 5 PM on weekdays</p>
<p>You need to deploy the infrastructure for App1. The solution must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support virtual machines deployed to <strong>four availability zones across two Azure regions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize costs by accumulating CPU credits during periods of low utilization.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the minimum number of virtual networks you should deploy, and which virtual machine size should you use? To answer, select the
appropriate options in the answer area</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_108.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of Virtual networks:  ✔ 2</strong>   ✅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual machine size  ✔ B-Series</strong>  ✅</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Number of Virtual networks:</p>
<p><strong>You need at least one virtual network per Azure region for the local resources, hence since you have two Azure regions, you'll need at least 2 virtual networks.</strong></p>
<p>Virtual machine size:</p>
<p><strong>The B-Series VM size is the best choice here because of the ability to bank CPU credits during periods of low utilization.</strong> </p>
<p>The B-series are burstable VMs that accumulate CPU credits during idle times and then consume these credits during periods of high CPU usage. This matches well with your requirement to minimize costs by accumulating CPU credits during periods of low utilization. Other series like A-Series, D-Series, and M-Series do
not have this functionality.</p>

<p><strong>You need to configure an Azure policy to ensure that the Azure SQL databases have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled.</strong> The solution must meet the security and compliance requirements</p>
<p>Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_119.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create an Azure policy definition that uses the deployIfNotExists</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to define the roles that deployIfNotExists and modify needs in the policy definition to successfully deploy the content of your included template.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create an Azure policy assignment</strong> ✅</p>
<p>When creating an assignment using the portal, Azure Policy both generates the managed identity and grants it the roles defined in roleDefinitionIds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Invoke a remediation task.</strong> ✅</p>
<p>Resources that are non-compliant to a deployIfNotExists or modify policy can be put into a compliant state through Remediation. Remediation is accomplished by instructing Azure Policy to run the deployIfNotExists effect or the modify operations of the assigned policy on your existing resources and subscriptions, whether that assignment is to a management group, a subscription, a resource group, or an individual resource. During evaluation, the policy assignment with deployIfNotExists or modify effects determines if there are non-compliant resources or subscriptions. When non- compliant resources or subscriptions are found, the details are provided on the Remediation page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an Azure policy definition that uses the deployIfNotExists effect and specifies TDE as a required setting. </li>
<li>Create an Azure policy assignment and assign the policy definition to the desired scope (e.g. subscription or resource group). </li>
<li>Invoke a remediation task to automatically enforce the policy and enable TDE on existing databases that do not have it enabled.</li>

<p><strong>Overview - Contoso, Ltd. is a research company that has a main office in Montreal</strong></p>
<p>Existing Environment -</p>
<p>Technical Environment - </p>
<p>The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com. Contoso has a single Azure subscription</p>
<p>Business Partnerships -</p>
<p>Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) guest accounts.</p>
<p>Requirements - </p>
<p>Planned Changes - Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure</p>
<p>App1 -</p>
<ul>
<li>App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1. </li>
<li>App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault</li>
</ul>
<p>App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region. </p>
<p>App1 has the following data requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance. </li>
<li>Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances. App1 will only be accessible from the internet. </li>
</ul>
<p>App1 has the following connection requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF). </li>
<li>Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances</li>
</ul>
<p>All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region.</p>
<p>Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. </p>
<p>The PowerShell script will run from a central location.</p>
<p><strong>App2 -</strong></p>
<p>App2 will be a .NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Save files to an Azure Storage account. </li>
<li>Replicate files to an on-premises location. </li>
<li>Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol. </li>
<li>You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution must not require changes to the application code</p>
<p>Application Development Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. </li>
<li>The development process must meet the following requirements: A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production. </li>
<li>After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version</li>
</ul>
<p>The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application.</p>
<p>Identity Requirements -</p>
<p>Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources:</p>
<p>Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. </p>
<p>Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests. The solution must minimize development effort.</p>
<p>Security Requirement - </p>
<ul>
<li>All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault. </li>
<li>Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The credentials must NOT be shared between services</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="question-1_5">Question 1</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a solution for the App1 maintenance task. </p>
<p>The solution must minimize costs. What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. an Azure logic app</strong> ✅</li>
<li>B. an Azure function</li>
<li>C. an Azure virtual machine </li>
<li>D. an App Service WebJob</li>
</ul>
<p>Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location.</p>
<p>App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can create and manage workflows with Azure PowerShell in Azure Logic Apps. </li>
<li>You can create a Consumption logic app in multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps by using the JSON file for a logic app workflow definition. </li>
<li>You can then manage your logic app by running the cmdlets in the Az.LogicApp PowerShell module</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure Logic App. The key here is the term "every hour" "Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. </p>
<p>The PowerShell script will run from a central location." In Azure Logic App, you can schedule every hour</p>
<h3 id="question-2_5">Question 2</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a solution that meets the application development requirements. What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. the Azure App Configuration service </li>
<li>B. an Azure Container Registry instance </li>
<li><strong>C. deployment slots</strong>     ✅</li>
<li>D. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) sources</li>
</ul>
<p>When you deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile back end, or API app to Azure App Service, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated App Service plan tier. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names.</p>
<p>App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot. </p>
<p>Deploying your application to a non-production slot has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot. </li>
<li>Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production</li>
</ul>
<p>This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a swap, the slot with previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can perform the same swap immediately to get your "last known good site" back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Application Development Requirements</p>
<p>Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production. </li>
<li>After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version. </li>
<li>The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="question-3_5">Question 3</h3>
<p>You need to recommend an App Service architecture that meets the requirements for App1. The solution must minimize costs. What should you recommend?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. one App Service Environment (ASE) per availability zone </li>
<li>B. one App Service Environment (ASE) per region</li>
<li><strong>C. one App Service plan per region</strong>   ✅</li>
<li>D. one App Service plan per availability zone</li>
</ul>
<p>No need for dedicated environment. So Azure Service Plan per region is enough</p>
<p><strong>C. One App Service Plan per region.</strong> </p>
<p>To be exact, the Basic App Service Plan offers up to 3 dedicated instances for your app to run.</p>
<ul>
<li>With Premium App Service App is enough in terms of zone redundant. It is offered in P2 and P3. </li>
<li>Comparing prices with ASE that is Isolated. ASE in zone redundant is charged with nine instances as minimum regardless of using 3 instances. So it is much expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="question-4_5">Question 4</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to ensure that App1 can access the third-party credentials and access strings. The solution must meet the security requirements. </p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_115.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: A system-assigned managed identity</strong> ✅</p>
<p>No one knows the credentials of managed identities.</p>
<p>Managed Identities exist in two formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>System assigned: in this scenario, the identity is linked to a single Azure Resource, eg a Virtual Machine, a Logic App, a Storage Account, Web App, Function, so almost anything. Next, they also live with the Azure Resource, which means they get deleted when the Azure Resource gets deleted. </li>
<li>User Assigned Managed Identity (incorrect for this question), which means that you first have to create it as a stand-alone Azure resource by itself, after which it can be linked to multiple Azure Resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>A system-assigned managed identity: This is an identity created by Azure for the App Service instance, which is tied to the lifecycle of this service and does not require the management of credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Box 2: role assignment</strong> ✅</p>
<p>A role assignment: Utilizing Azure role-based access control (RBAC), you can assign a specific role to the managed identity, like “Key Vault Secrets User”, to retrieve secrets from the Key Vault.</p>
<p>Role assignment. More granular than access policy</p>

<h3 id="question-7_5">Question 7</h3>
<p>What should you recommend to meet the monitoring requirements for App2?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. VM insights </li>
<li><strong>B. Azure Application Insights</strong> ✅</li>
<li>C. Microsoft Sentinel </li>
<li>D. Container insights</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenario: You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code. </p>
<ul>
<li>Can't be A -&gt; VM Insight as it is not running on a VM. </li>
<li>Can't be C -&gt; Microsoft sentinel which is a SIEM </li>
<li>Can't be D -&gt; Not running in a container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="question-8_5">Question 8</h3>
<p><strong>You need to recommend a solution that meets the file storage requirements for App2.</strong></p>
<p>What should you deploy to the Azure subscription and the on-premises network? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct locations. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_125.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>Box 1: Azure Files -</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>✑ Save files to an Azure Storage account. </li>
<li>✑ Replicate files to an on-premises location. </li>
<li>✑ Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Box 2: Azure File Sync</strong></p>
<p>Use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world.</p>

<h3 id="question-9_5">Question 9</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a solution that meets the data requirements for App1. </p>
<p>What should you recommend deploying to each availability zone that contains an instance of App1?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. an Azure Cosmos DB that uses multi-region writes</strong> ✅</li>
<li>B. an Azure Data Lake store that uses geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) </li>
<li>C. an Azure Storage account that uses geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenario: App1 has the following data requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>✑ Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance. </li>
<li>✑ Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB: Each partition across all the regions is replicated. Each region contains all the data partitions of an Azure Cosmos container and can serve reads as well as serve writes when multi-region writes is enabled</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect Answers:</strong></p>
<p>B, D: GZRS protects against failures. Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages. However, that data is available to be read only if the customer or Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region. </p>
<p>C: Active geo-replication is designed as a business continuity solution that lets you perform quick disaster recovery of individual databases in case of a regional disaster or a large scale outage. Once geo-replication is set up, you can initiate a geo-failover to a geo-secondary in a different Azure region. The geo-failover is initiated programmatically by the application or manually by the user</p>

<p>Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication. </p>
<p>As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&amp;D operations will remain on-premises.</p>
<p>Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure</p>
<p><strong>Requirements: Technical Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website content must be easily updated from a single point. </li>
<li>User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. </li>
<li>Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. </li>
<li>Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. </li>
<li>
<p>Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. </p>
</li>
<li>An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. </li>
<li>In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. </li>
<li>Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements: Database Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.</li>
<li>To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. </li>
<li>Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements: Security Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company.</li>
<li>Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails.</li>
<li>Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials. </li>
<li>All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). </li>
<li>The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company</li>
</ul>
<p>Question HOTSPOT -</p>
<h3 id="question-1_6">Question 1</h3>
<p><strong>You are evaluating the components of the migration to Azure that require you to provision an Azure Storage account.</strong></p>
<p>For each of the following statements, select</p>
<p>Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_116.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<p><strong>1. SQL Migration:</strong></p>
<p>Because onprem licenses must be used, whenever possible=&gt; BYOL. Preferred SQL Migration in this case is uploading VHD from onprem Hyper-V- VM and create a new Azure VM</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Website content storage is more like html, css, media. I think you would need a storage account for that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database metrics: For SQL Server on Azure VMs it is possible to send metrics to 3 services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a) Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor</p>
</li>
<li>b) Azure Event Hub </li>
<li>
<p>c) Azure Storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You must provision an Azure storage account for the SQL server database migration</strong>: Yes. Azure Storage is often used as a staging area for migrations, including SQL Server databases.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>You must provision an Azure storage account for the web site content storage</strong>: Yes. Azure Storage can be used to store static website content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You must provision an Azure storage account for the Database metric monitoring</strong>: No. Database metrics are typically monitored using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, not Azure Storage. </p>
<ul>
<li>However, logs and metrics could potentially be exported to Azure Storage for long-term retention or further analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQL Migration: Y</strong> because Database migration assistant requires a Storage Account to store the database backup files </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Web app content: Y</strong> Content needs to be updated from an easy to use single point. That's a storage account. I don't consider the available storage that's built into an App Service as easily accessible or a 'single point' </li>
<li><strong>Database metrics: N</strong> Log Analytics workspace has its own storage, it doesn't require you to link your own storage account (although it's possible)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="question-2_6">Question 2</h3>
<p>What should you include in the identity management strategy to support the planned changes?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Deploy domain controllers for corp.fabrikam.com to virtual networks in Azure.</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>B. Move all the domain controllers from corp.fabrikam.com to virtual networks in Azure. </li>
<li>C. Deploy a new Azure AD tenant for the authentication of new R&amp;D projects. </li>
<li>D. Deploy domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest to virtual networks in Azure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. (This requires domain controllers in Azure). </p>
<p>Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an Internet link fails. (This requires domain controllers on-premises).</p>
<h3 id="question-3_6">Question 3</h3>
<p><strong>To meet the authentication requirements of Fabrikam, what should you include in the solution?</strong></p>
<p>To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_120.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>1=1:Single tenant creation required only due to RD restrictions implemented. </li>
<li>2=1:Need to add custom domain due to default .onmicrosoft.com domain on tenant creation</li>
<li>3=2 Two policies requires, can't have multiple actions to block + allow on single conditional access policies. </li>
</ul>
<p>One required for admin MFA, second to block external access as per requirements.</p>
<h3 id="question-4_6">Question 4</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a notification solution for the IT Support distribution group. </p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. a SendGrid account with advanced reporting </li>
<li>B. an action group </li>
<li>C. Azure Network Watcher </li>
<li><strong>D. Azure AD Connect Health</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p>An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services.</p>
<p>Note: You can configure the Azure AD Connect Health service to send email notifications when alerts indicate that your identity infrastructure is not healthy. his occurs when an alert is generated, and when it is resolved.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_121.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<h3 id="question-5_6">Question 5</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a solution to meet the database retention requirements. What should you recommend?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A. Configure a long-term retention policy for the database.</strong>  ✅</li>
<li>B. Configure Azure Site Recovery. </li>
<li>C. Use automatic Azure SQL Database backups. </li>
<li>D. Configure geo-replication of the database.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>Scenario: Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements. </p>
<p>Many applications have regulatory, compliance, or other business purposes that require you to retain database backups beyond the 7-35 days provided by Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance automatic backups. </p>
<p>By using the long-term retention (LTR) feature, you can store specified SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance full backups in Azure Blob storage with configured redundancy for up to 10 years. LTR backups can then be restored as a new database</p>
<h3 id="question-6_6">Question 6</h3>
<p>You need to recommend a data storage strategy for WebApp1. </p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. an Azure virtual machine that runs SQL Server </li>
<li>B. a fixed-size DTU Azure SQL database </li>
<li>C. an Azure SQL Database elastic pool </li>
<li><strong>D. a vCore-based Azure SQL database</strong>  ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>
<p>The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized. Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings.</p>
<p>Note: A virtual core (vCore) represents a logical CPU and offers you the option to choose between generations of hardware and the physical characteristics of the hardware (for example, the number of cores, the memory, and the storage size). The vCore-based purchasing model gives you flexibility, control, transparency of individual resource consumption, and a straightforward way to translate on-premises workload requirements to the cloud. This model optimizes price, and allows you to choose compute, memory, and storage resources based on your workload needs.</p>
<p>Incorrect: </p>
<p><strong>Not C: Azure SQL Database elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases, not for a single database.</strong></p>
<p><strong>D. vCore-based SQL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirement: Use existing on-premises licenses whenever possible</strong></p>
<p>You can only apply the Azure Hybrid licensing model when you choose a vCore-based purchasing model and the provisioned compute tier for your Azure SQL Database. Azure Hybrid Benefit isn't available for service tiers under the DTU-based purchasing model or for the serverless compute tier.</p>
<h3 id="question-7_6">Question 7</h3>
<p>You design a solution for the web tier of WebApp1 as shown in the exhibit.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/az305_12_128.png" title="Body image" /></p>

<p><strong>Box 1: Yes</strong> - Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Traffic Manager is resilient to failure, including the failure of an entire Azure region.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Yes) Traffic manager distributes load to two sites (redundancy). </li>
<li>(Yes) The graphic clearly shows an "Azure Web App", which is production. By default, production web apps support auto scale. </li>
<li>(No) Azure Traffic manager does automatic failover, so no manual configuration is necessary</li>
</ul>
