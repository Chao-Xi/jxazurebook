# Chap - 2  Identity Security  

## 3 Design for Identity Security

### 3-1 Introduction

**Importance of Identity Security**

> Identity security is more than just assigning permissions to users.

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_1.png "Body image")

#### 1 Identity Security Overview:

* Users, Azure AD tenant, and resources are interconnected through identities.
* **Users authenticate their identities within the Azure AD tenant** and are **granted access permissions to resources**.


#### 2 Challenges in Identity Security:

* Need to review and assess if assigned **permissions are still necessary**.
* Monitoring for suspicious activities that may indicate compromised user accounts.
* Consideration of **additional security risks** related to identities.

#### 3 Advanced Identity Security Features:

* Implementing additional controls beyond basic access permissions.
* Addressing different scenarios where unique security controls are needed.
* Example scenario: **Allowing or blocking access based on the location or type of connection** (e.g., internet cafe).

#### 4 Protection of Identities:

* Emphasis on protecting privileges and identities.
* Implementing controls to safeguard identities in diverse scenarios.
* Discussion on the importance of having additional security measures to secure identities effectively.


### 3-2 Securing Identities with Azure AD Identity Protection

Purpose of Azure AD Identity Protection:

* Protecting identities from compromise.
* Detecting risks using Microsoft security team and AI.

#### Securing Identities with Azure AD Identity Protection

**Feature Overview**

* **Detection**： Automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks.
* **Risk Analysis**： Easy access to risk-related data and reports within the Azure Portal
* **Integration**: Export data and integrate with security monitoring tools.

#### Configuration Overview

**Configuration and Usage:**

* Requires Azure AD Premium P2 licensing.
* Focuses on detecting risks like leaked credentials and suspicious sign-ins.
* **Utilizes risk policies for managing risks**.
* Two main policies: **Sign-in risk policies (real-time detection) and User risk policies (offline detection)**.

#### **Sign-in Risk Policies:**

* Monitor **sign-ins for suspicious activity**.
* Configure policies based on risk levels and actions like blocking access or requiring multi-factor authentication.

#### **User Risk Policies:**

* **Detect offline threats and suspicious user activity.**
* Configure policies to block access, enforce password changes, or allow access under certain conditions.


![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_2.png "Body image")

* **Azure AD Tenant**: Requires Azure AD Premium P2 licensing.
* **Risk Events**
	* Risks that Identity Protection is monitoring for both proactively and reactively.
	* This includes:
		* Users with leaked credentials
		* Sign-ins from anonymous IP addresses
		* Impossible travel to atypical locations
		* Sign-ins from infected devices
		* Sign-ins from IP addresses with suspicious activity
		* Sign-ins from unfamiliar locations

* **Risk Policies**	
	* Risk policies define what action to take if risk has been found to be associated with an identity.


#### Sign-In Risk Policy

* **Real-Time Detection**

Takes effect in real time. These policies can be used to block a sign-in as it occurs.

* **Assignment**

Describes when the policy will trigger. This includes defining the applicable users/groups and the risk level condition.

* **Control**

Describes what to do when the policy triggers. The action can be to block or allow a sign-in, or allow access but require MFA.

**Identity Protection | Sign-in risk policy**

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_3.png "Body image")

#### User Risk Policy

**Offline Detection**

Takes effect offline. These policies can identify
user accounts that are found to be at risk.

**Assignment**

* Describes when the policy will trigger.
* This includes defining the applicable users/groups and the risk level condition.

**Control**

* Describes what to do when the policy triggers. 
* The action can be to block or allow access, or force a password change.

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_4.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_5.png "Body image")

#### Additional Features:

* MFA registration policy for enforcing multi-factor authentication.

* Leveraging risk data in other services like Conditional Access.

### 3-3 Protecting Resources with Azure AD Conditional Access 

#### Purpose of Azure AD Conditional Access:

* Focus on security controls for different scenarios.
* Enables enforcing different types of controls (**allow, block, require additional factors**) based on various conditions.

#### Features and Scenarios:

* Provides flexibility in controlling access based on user location, device type, risk levels, etc.
* Includes features like **country IP addresses, allowed locations, trusted locations, different device types, and risk levels** from Azure AD Identity Protection.


Security controls and restrictions that are tailored to
different scenarios.

**Flexible Security Controls**

Security isn't one size fits all. 

Conditional Access allows us to configure different rules for different scenarios.

**Leverages Various Signals**

There are a variety of signals that can be checked, including a user's location, risk level, and much more.

**Can Enforce Different Controls**

With Conditional Access, we can require users to meet special conditions before granting access.

#### Conditional Access Policies

**Configuration Overview:**

* Requires Azure AD Premium P1 licensing.
* Configured through Conditional Access policies that define **assignment, conditions, and controls**.
* Policies can be applied to specific users, groups, cloud applications, or scenarios based on various signals.

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_6.png "Body image")

**Azure AD Tenant**： Requires Azure AD Premium P1 licensing.

**Access Policy: Assignment**

* The users/groups that the policy applies to, as well as the cloud app or action being accessed.

* It is also possible to include the conditions under which access is being requested.

**Access Policy: Access Controls**

* What will happen if the conditions are met?
* This can include blocking/allowing access, or even report-only mode for auditing purposes.


**Policy Configuration:**

* **Assignments**: Define who the policy applies to (users, groups, cloud apps).
* **Conditions**: Specify conditions such as user risk, sign-in risk, device type, and location.
* **Controls**: Grant access based on specified conditions (e.g., require multifactor authentication, Azure AD domain-joined device).

**Use Report-Only mode, or the What If tool to evaluate policies.**

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_7.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_8.png "Body image")

**Assignments**

* Users or workload identities
* Cloud apps or actions 
* Conditions
* Access controls

#### Best Practices:

* Be cautious to avoid unintentionally locking out users.
* Use report-only mode for monitoring policies without enforcing them.
* Utilize the 'what if' tool to simulate scenarios and understand the impact of policies.


![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_9.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_10.png "Body image")

#### Recommendations:

* Azure AD Conditional Access is a flexible tool for securing environments.
* Consider using the what if tool to simulate scenarios and understand policy impacts.
* Ensure proper exclusions for critical users to prevent unintended access restrictions.


### 3-4 Protecting Privileges with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

**Purpose of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**

> Protecting privileges for
Azure AD and Azure roles.

* **Protect**

Enforce additional workflow-like tasks for users to be provided with their privileges.

* **Audit**

Provide an audit trail with information on privileged usage and justification.

* **Review**

Simplify and automate the ability to review whether privileges are still required by users.

#### The Problem with Privileges

**Scenario and Problems Addressed**:
  
- Addresses issues such as unnecessary continuous access to high-level privileges.
- Protects against scenarios where users may retain privileges they no longer need or use, leading to potential security risks.
 - Helps in managing access based on specific project requirements or timeframes.

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_11.png "Body image")

**Just-in-time access**: privileges are only assigned but not **activated until they are required**.

**Time-bound access**: privileges are deactivated after a set period of time using start/end dates.

**Approval**: users who are assigned privileges must request approval before they will be activated.

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** enforce the use of MFA to activate any role.

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_12.png "Body image")


#### Getting Started with PIM

* **STEP 1**

Privileged Identity Management requires **Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 licensing**.

* **STEP 2**

PIM is automatically enabled for an organization **when a user with a privileged role first accesses it**.

* **STEP 3**

Configure role settings for Azure and Azure AD roles (note: Azure requires role discovery).

## 4 Design a Compute Strategy

### 4-1 Introduction

#### **Hosting and Shared Responsibility**

**Shared Responsibility Model:**

* In the cloud, the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider, but customers are still responsible **for the operating system, runtime, applications, and code**.

* Different cloud service models like **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Functions as a Service (FaaS)** offer varying levels of control and management responsibilities.

#### Cloud Service Models:

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Customers are responsible for the operating system, runtime, applications, and code on virtual machines.

Infra => **OS => Runtime  => Apps  => Functions**


* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Customers only manage the applications and features of their code, not the underlying infrastructure.


Infra => OS => Runtime  => **Apps  => Functions**

* Functions as a Service (FaaS): Customers are responsible for developing, configuring, and deploying their code, with minimal management of infrastructure.

Infra => OS => Runtime  => Apps  => **Functions**


**The Path to the Cloud Is Individual**

![Alt Image Text](../images/az305_2_22.png "Body image")


**Considerations for Migration:**

* Organizations should evaluate factors like workload priorities, existing infrastructure, budget constraints, and access to underlying code when deciding on migration strategies.
* Cloud migration may involve a mix of service models based on workload characteristics and optimization opportunities.


**Continuous Optimization:**

* Organizations should continuously assess and optimize workloads in the cloud to improve performance, cost-effectiveness, and resource utilization.
* Transitioning from traditional solutions to cloud-native services like PaaS can enhance efficiency and performance.
