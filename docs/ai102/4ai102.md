## 3️⃣ Slide-by-Slide Workshop Outline (Exam-Focused)

---

### 🟦 Slide 1 — Exam Mindset (5 min)

**Key Message**

> AI-102 is **NOT** ML theory
> It’s **service selection + deployment decisions**

**Say this explicitly**

* 80% scenario-based
* Wrong answers are *technically valid but wrong context*
* Keywords matter more than code

📌 **Exam Trigger Words**

| Keyword               | Meaning                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| *Minimize dev effort* | Prebuilt service                  |
| *Offline / on-prem*   | Container                         |
| *Single key*          | CognitiveServices (multi-service) |
| *Private traffic*     | Private Endpoint                  |

---

### 🟦 Slide 2 — Azure AI Service Decision Map (5 min)

**Golden Rule**

> If Microsoft already solved it → **don’t train**

| Requirement            | Correct Service  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Chit-chat intent       | LUIS             |
| Knowledge base         | QnA Maker        |
| Sentiment              | Text Analytics   |
| Language detection     | Text Analytics   |
| Receipt extraction     | Form Recognizer  |
| OCR only               | Computer Vision  |
| Predictive maintenance | Anomaly Detector |
| Correlated sensors     | Metrics Advisor  |

🚫 **Trap**
Custom Vision / Azure ML when “minimize effort” is stated.

---

### 🟦 Slide 3 — Language + Bot Scenarios (10 min)

**High-Frequency Exam Combo**

> “Chit-chat + KB + sentiment + multilingual”

✅ **Correct Answer Pattern**

```
LUIS + QnA Maker + Text Analytics
```

❌ **Why Dispatch is often wrong**

* Dispatch is for routing *between bots*
* Exam often *does not require routing*

💡 **Exam Drill**

> “Which service automatically detects language?”
> ➡️ **Text Analytics**, not Translator

---

### 🟦 Slide 4 — Speech & Streaming (5 min)

**Exam Pattern**

> “Streaming MP3 speech to text”

✅ Required:

* `AudioStreamFormat.GetCompressedFormat(MP3)`
* `SpeechRecognizer`

🚫 Wrong:

* `SpeechSynthesizer` (TTS)
* `KeywordRecognizer`

📌 Keyword: *streaming*, *MP3* → **CompressedFormat**

---

### 🟦 Slide 5 — Vision vs Form Recognizer (8 min)

**Decision Table (very exam-heavy)**

| Scenario                 | Correct         |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Receipts, invoices       | Form Recognizer |
| Structured fields        | Form Recognizer |
| OCR only                 | Computer Vision |
| PPE detection            | Face API        |
| Captions for blind users | `describeImage` |

🚫 **Trap**

> “Receipts” ≠ OCR
> Receipts = **prebuilt Form Recognizer**

---

### 🟦 Slide 6 — Containers & Security (8 min)

**Exam Keywords**

* On-prem
* Limited connectivity
* No internet
* Secure keys

✅ **Correct Order Pattern**

1. Pull image from MCR
2. Push to ACR (RBAC)
3. Distribute `docker run` script
4. Run container

📌 **Mandatory container flags**

```
Eula=accept
Billing={ENDPOINT}
ApiKey={KEY}
```

🚫 Don’t put keys directly in CLI history.

---

```

❌ Translator ≠ language detection
❌ Dispatch ≠ required unless routing bots

---

### Exam Scenario Drill (5 min)

> “Build a chatbot that:
>
> * Supports chit-chat
> * Uses a KB
> * Performs sentiment analysis
> * Selects best language automatically”

Ask teams to vote.

✅ **Correct**
`LUIS + QnA Maker + Text Analytics`

🚫 Explain why Dispatch is *tempting but wrong*.

---

### Part B — Speech Streaming (5 min)

**Exam keyword**: *streaming MP3*
