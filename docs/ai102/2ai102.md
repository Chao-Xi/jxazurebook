	- Gain a deeper understanding of customer opinions with sentiment analysis. The Language Detection feature of the Azure Text Analytics REST API evaluates text input

Incorrect Answers:

A, B, D: Dispatch uses sample utterances for each of your bot's different tasks (LUIS, QnA Maker, or custom), and builds a model that can be
used to properly route your user's request to the right task, even across multiple bots.


### Question #4

Your company wants to **reduce how long it takes for employees to log receipts in expense reports**. All the receipts are in English.

You need to extract top-level information from the receipts, such as the vendor and the transaction total. The solution must minimize development effort.

List of Different Services are:

- ✑ Decision
- ✑ Language (includes sentiment analysis)
- ✑ Speech
- ✑ Vision (includes OCR)
- ✑ Web Search


PUT: 

- puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI.
- If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.
- If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one.

**POST: POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request.**

### Question #6

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website.

**You plan to monitor the sales system to ensure that it provides equitable results regardless of the user's location or background.**

Which two responsible AI principles provide guidance to meet the monitoring requirements? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. transparency
- **B. fairness**  ✅
- **C. inclusiveness**  ✅
- D. reliability and safety
- E. privacy and security


Correct Answer: BC

- AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- AI systems should perform reliably and safely.


**Fairness** is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle is even more important when AI systems are being
developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or
religion bias toward a group or individual.


**Inclusiveness** mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand
and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition
technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other impairments.


### Question #7

You plan to use containerized versions of the Anomaly Detector API on local devices for testing and in on-premises datacenters.

You need to ensure that the containerized deployments meet the following requirements:

- ✑ Prevent billing and API information from being stored in the command-line histories of the devices that run the container.
- ✑ Control access to the container images by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).


Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and
arrange them in the correct order.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_7.png "Body image")

1. Create a custom docker file
2. Pull the container image (in the dockerfile)
3. Build the image
4. Push to ACR


### Question #8

You plan to deploy a containerized version of an Azure Cognitive Services service that will be used for text analysis.

You configure **https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com** as the endpoint URI for the service, and you pull the latest version of the Text Analytics Sentiment Analysis container.

You need to run the container on an Azure virtual machine by using Docker.

How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_8.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_9.png "Body image")

```
Box 1: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment

To run the Sentiment Analysis v3 container, execute the following docker run command. 

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus \ 
	mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
	Eula=accept \
	Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
	ApiKey={API_KEY} 

is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API. https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com


Box 2: https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com

{ENDPOINT_URI} is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API: https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.a The endpoint for
accessing the Text
```


### Question #9

You have the following C# method for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_10.png "Body image")

You need to call the method to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

Which code should you use?

```
A. create_resource(client, "res", "ComputerVision", "FO", "westus")
B. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision Prediction", "FO", "westus")
C. create_resource(client, "res1", "ComputerVision", "SO", "westus")
D. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "SO", "westus")
```


**A, as there is free tier available for Computer Vision service.**

- Free - Web/Container
- 20 per minute
- 5,000 free transactions per month

The ComputerVision resource is more commonly used because it comes with pre-built capabilities for image analysis, including caption generation, without the need to train a custom model. 

On the other hand, the CustomVision.Prediction you must be specifically trained to support generating captions


### Question #10

You successfully run the following HTTP request.

```
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/18c51a87-3a69-47a8-aedc-a54745f708a1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/contoso1/regenerateKey?api-version=2017-04-18
Body{"keyName": "Key2"}
```


What is the result of the request?


- A. A key for Azure Cognitive Services was generated in Azure Key Vault.
- B. A new query key was generated.
- C. The primary subscription key and the secondary subscription key were rotated.
- **D. The secondary subscription key was reset**.   ✅

This response is indicated by the "keyName": "Key2" in the request body, specifying that the secondary subscription key (Key2) should be regenerated.

> B is wrong. Query key is for search service. The Rest request of create query key is like POST

The request is to the Azure Management API to regenerate a key for an Azure Cognitive Services account (contoso1). The body of the request
specifies {"keyName": "Key2"}, which indicates that the operation is targeted at the secondary subscription key (commonly referred to as Key2 in Azure Cognitive Services management). The regenerateKey action causes the specified key to be reset, generating a new key value for it while invalidating the old one.

### Question #11

You build a custom Form Recognizer model.

You receive sample files to use for training the model as shown in the following table

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_11.png "Body image")

Which three files can you use to train the model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. File1**

- B. File2

- **C. File3**

- D. File4

- E. File5

- **F. File6**


**ACF**


Form Recognizer works on input documents that meet these requirements:

Format must be JPG, PNG, PDF (text or scanned), or TIFF. Text-embedded PDFs are best because there's no possibility of error in character extraction and location.

**File size must be less than 50 MB.**


**File 2 and 5 are excluded.**

New service limits now goes up to 500MB so...

File 1, 3, and 6 are correct for "training the model", however if MSFT remove the word "training" from the question - be careful.

For custom model training the total size is still 50MB. Answer is correct

A. File1 (PDF)

C. File3 (JPG)

F. File6 (JPG)


### Question #12

A customer uses Azure Cognitive Search.

The customer plans to enable a server-side encryption and use customer-managed keys (CMK) stored in Azure. What are three implications of the planned change? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. The index size will increase.**

- **B. Query times will increase**.

- C. A self-signed X.509 certificate is required.

- D. The index size will decrease.

- E. Query times will decrease.

- **F. Azure Key Vault is required**.


**Should be ABF (use AKV for customer managed key)**


"Customer-managed keys require an additional billable service, Azure Key Vault, which can be in a different region, but under the same subscription, as Azure Cognitive Search. Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance."

A. **The index size will increase. Enabling CMK encryption increases the index size1**.

B. Query times will increase. Enabling CMK encryption degrades query performance. **You can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times1**.

F. Azure Key Vault is required. CMK encryption depends on Azure Key Vault. You can create your own encryption keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use Azure Key Vault APIs to generate encryption keys1


### Question #13

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website. You plan to notify users that their data has been processed by the sales system.

Which responsible AI principle does this help meet?

- **A. transparency**

- B. fairness

- C. inclusiveness

- D. reliability and safety

The correct answer is A, transparency: "When an AI application relies on personal data, such as a facial recognition system that takes images of people to recognize them; you should make it clear to the user how their data is used and retained, and who has access to it."


- "Transparency: AI systems should be understandable."


- "Reliability and safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely."

### Question #14


Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing traffic over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

**The Azure Private Link should use a private endpoint, not a public endpoint.**

**Private Link service can be accessed from approved private endpoints in any public region.**


Answer is no. **you should create a private link with private endpoint**


### Question #15

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing traffic over the public internet.

Solution: **You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you configure an IP firewall rule.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**
  
**Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.**

The answer is B because the traffic should not be routed over internet. 

"By default, Azure AI Search is configured to allow connections over a public endpoint. Access to a search service through the public endpoint is protected by authentication and authorization protocols, but the endpoint itself is open to the internet at the network layer for data plane requests."


### Question #16

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing traffic over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you configure a network security group (NSG) for vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.

###  Question #17

You plan to perform predictive maintenance.


You collect IoT sensor data from 100 industrial machines for a year. Each machine has 50 different sensors that generate data at one-minute intervals. In total, you have 5,000 time series datasets.

You need to identify unusual values in each time series to help predict machinery failures.

Which Azure service should you use?

- **A. Anomaly Detector**

- B. Cognitive Search

- C. Form Recognizer

- D. Custom Vision

A is the answer.

**Anomaly Detector is an AI service with a set of APIs, which enables you to monitor and detect anomalies in your time series data with little machine learning (ML) knowledge, either batch validation or real-time inference**.

**A. Azure AI Anomaly Detector**

### Question #18

### Question #19


You are developing an internet-based training solution for remote learners.

Your company identifies that during the training, some learners leave their desk for long periods or become distracted.


You need to use a video and audio feed from each learner's computer to detect whether the learner is present and paying attention. The solution must minimize development effort and identify each learner.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use for each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_14.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_15.png "Body image")


1. Face
2. Face
3. Speech

- From Video feed - Face 
- Facial Expression from - Face 
- Audio Feed is - Speech


### Question #20

You plan to provision a QnA Maker service in a new resource group named RG1.

In RG1, you create an App Service plan named AP1.

Which two Azure resources are automatically created in RG1 when you provision the QnA Maker service? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. Language Understanding

- B. Azure SQL Database

- C. Azure Storage

- **D. Azure Cognitive Search**

- **E. Azure App Service**

"When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the data in your own Azure subscription. Azure Search is used to index your data." & "When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the runtime in your own Azure subscription. App Service is the compute engine that runs the QnA Maker queries for you."


### Question #21

You are building a language model by using a Language Understanding (classic) service. 

You create a new Language Understanding (classic) resource.

You need to add more contributors

What should you use?

- A. a conditional access policy in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

- **B. the Access control (IAM) page for the authoring resources in the Azure portal**

- C. the Access control (IAM) page for the prediction resources in the Azure portal

B is the answer.

In the Azure portal, find your Language Understanding (LUIS) authoring resource. It has the type LUIS.Authoring. In the resource's Access Control (IAM) page, add the role of contributor for the user that you want to contribute.

### Question #22

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

**Using a higher tier does not imply scaling replicas or partitions.**


### Question #23

You need to develop an automated call handling system that can respond to callers in their own language. The system will support only French and English.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use to meet each requirement? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct requirements. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bat between panes or scroll to view content.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_16.png "Body image")



1. **Speech to Text**
2. **Text to Speech**

---
- Speech to Text with AutoDetectSourceLanguageConfig. It can't be Text Analytics because the input is callers' voice.
- Text to Speech: the output is voice.


### Question #24

You have receipts that are accessible from a URL.

You need to extract data from the receipts by using Form Recognizer and the SDK. The solution must use a prebuilt model. Which client and method should you use?

- A. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- B. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- **C. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method**

- D. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method


**Should be C**

```
private static async Task AnalyzeReceipt(
	FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient, string receiptUri)
	RecognizedFormCollection receipts = await recognizerClient.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUrl)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
)
```

Option A: **The StartRecognizeContentFromUri method is used to extract layout information such as tables, lines, words, and selection marks. It’ not specifically designed for receipts**.

Option B: **The FormTrainingClient is used to train custom models, not to extract data from documents using prebuilt models**. Also, the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method, as mentioned above, is not specifically designed for receipts.

Option D: Similar to option B, the FormTrainingClient is not suitable for this scenario as it’s used for training custom models. The StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method would be correct if used with FormRecognizerClient.


### Question #25

You have a collection of 50,000 scanned documents that contain text.

You plan to make the text available through Azure Cognitive Search.

**You need to configure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and text analytics. The solution must minimize costs**.

What should you attach to the skillset?

- A. a new Computer Vision resource

- B. a free (Limited enrichments) Cognitive Services resource

- C. an Azure Machine Learning Designer pipeline

- **D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

**Selected Answer: D**

You need to configure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and "text analytics"... Just because of this second requirement Answer is a Multi Cognitive Service (D), alone vision service (=OCR wont make any text analytics, text extraction is not text analytics !)


Based on the information from the official Azure documentation, the most cost-effective way to configure an enrichment pipeline for OCR and text analytics in Azure Cognitive Search would be to use a billable Cognitive Services resource. This is because built-in skills, such as OCR and text analytics, are based on the Cognitive Services APIs and unless your content input is small, you would need to attach a billable Cognitive Services resource to run larger workloads.


**D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

This option allows you to use the necessary built-in skills for OCR and text analytics and can handle larger workloads, which would be necessary for processing a large number of documents. The S0 pricing tier is a standard tier that provides a balance between cost and capabilities.


D - free tier is limited to 10,000 documents


### Question #26

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add indexes.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- B. No

**Correct Answer: B**


**Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier**.

Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

> "How your search queries perform is directly connected to the size and complexity of your indexes. The smaller and more optimized your indexes, the fast Azure Cognitive Search can respond to queries.

If your index has been optimized but the performance still isn't where it needs to be, you can choose to scale up or scale out your search service.

**The solution provided does not directly address the issue of search query requests being throttled. Adding indexes can improve search performance by optimizing the search process, but it may not directly address throttling issues.**


### Question #27

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

Solution: You enable customer-managed key (CMK) encryption.

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not affect throttling.

Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.


Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

**Reason for choosing this option: Enabling customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not directly impact the throttling of search query requests in Azure Cognitive Search service. CMK encryption is used for data-at-rest encryption and does not affect the performance or capacity of the search service.**



### Question #28

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

**You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing traffc over the public internet.**

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?

- **A. Yes**

- B. No

**"deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1." is correct.**



**A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network**.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

- ✑ Azure Storage 
- ✑ Azure Cosmos DB 
- ✑ Azure SQL Database 
- ✑ Your own service using a Private Link Service.

### Question #29

You have a **Language Understanding resource** named lu1.

You build and deploy an Azure bot named bot1 that uses lu1.

You need to ensure that bot1 adheres to the Microsoft responsible AI principle of inclusiveness. How should you extend bot1?


- A. Implement authentication for bot1.

- B. Enable active learning for lu1.

- C. Host lu1 in a container.

- **D. Add Direct Line Speech to bot1.**


Correct Answer: D

Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.

**Direct Line Speech is a robust, end-to-end solution for creating a flexible, extensible voice assistant.** 

**It is powered by the Bot Framework and its Direct Line Speech channel, that is optimized for voice-in, voice-out interaction with bots.**


Incorrect:

Not B: The Active learning suggestions feature allows you to improve the quality of your knowledge base by suggesting alternative questions, based on user- submissions, to your question and answer pair. You review those suggestions, either adding them to existing questions or rejecting them.


### Question #30

You are building an app that will process incoming email and direct messages to either French or English language support teams. Which Azure Cognitive Services API should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_17.png "Body image")


**Box1:**

**`https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com `**


Box2:

**`/text/analytics/v3.1/languages`**

NOTE:

Pay special attention to the Sample Request provided. Request to the API should be of the form:


**`POST {Endpoint}/text/analytics/v3.0/languages `**


**Where the {Endpoint} as stated under the sub-heading "URI Parameters" was described as quoted here (see "Description" column of the table): "Supported Cognitive Services endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)."**

**So the sample given shows the correct format of the *endpoint* as `https://{location}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`**

### Question #31


You have an Azure Cognitive Search instance that indexes purchase orders by using Form Recognizer.

You need to analyze the extracted information by using Microsoft Power BI. The solution must minimize development effort. What should you add to the indexer?


- A. a projection group

- **B. a table projection**

- C. a file projection

- D. an object projection

**Should be B . Its for Tables the Power BI**

"Use Power BI for data exploration. This tool works best when the data is in Azure Table Storage. Within Power BI, you can manipulate data into new tables that are easier to query and analyze"


You receive a JSON object, so ObjectProjection is the most appropriate way to explore:

Objects: "Used when you need the full JSON representation of your data and enrichments in one JSON document. **As with table projections, only valid JSON objects can be projected as objects, and shaping can help you do that.**"


**B is the correct answer. See below to understand the workflow:**

Purchase Orders (POs) -> Form Recognizer -> OCR -> JSON (extracted info from POs) -> Shaper skill -> JSON -> Table Projection -> JSON -> Power BI


### Question #32


You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add replicas.**

Does this meet the goal?


- **A. Yes**

- B. No

**A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.**


**"add replicas" is correct.**

- A. Enable a virtual network service endpoint.

- **B. Configure a custom subdomain.**

- C. Request an X.509 certificate.

- **D. Create a private endpoint.**

- E. Create a Conditional Access policy.


To authenticate with a Microsoft Entra token, the Speech resource must have a custom subdomain and use a private endpoint. 

The Speech service uses custom subdomains with private endpoints only


To authenticate with a Microsoft Entra token, the Speech resource must have a custom subdomain and use a private endpoint. The Speech service uses custom subdomains with private endpoints only.


- B. Configure a custom subdomain: This is necessary because Azure AD authentication requires a custom domain for the Speech service.

- D. Create a private endpoint: This ensures secure communication between the app and the Speech service.

These actions align with the best practices for securing Azure services and enable the app to use Azure AD tokens for authentication.

B. Configure a custom subdomain: This is necessary when using Azure AD authentication with a private endpoint. However, it's also a requirement for using Azure AD authentication in general with the Speech service.

C. Request an X.509 certificate: This is not needed for Azure AD token-based authentication. It's typically used for client certificate authentication


### Question #58

You plan to deploy an Azure OpenAI resource by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

You need to ensure that the resource can respond to 600 requests per minute.

How should you complete the template? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_34.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_35.png "Body image")

Azure OpenAI allows you to manage how frequently your application can make inferencing requests. Your rate limits are based on Tokens-perMinute (TPM). For example, if you have a capacity of 1, this equals 1,000 TPM, and the rate limit of requests you can make per minute (RPM) is calculated using a ratio. For every 1,000 TPM, you can make 6 RPM.

When a deployment is created, the assigned TPM will directly map to the tokens-per-minute rate limit enforced on its inferencing requests. A Requests-Per-Minute (RPM) rate limit will also be enforced whose value is set proportionally to the TPM assignment using the following ratio:

**6 RPM per 1000 TPM.**

**So the math is 600 RPM needs 100000 TPM which translates to capacity 100**

### Question #59

You have an app that manages feedback.

You need to ensure that the app can detect negative comments by using the Sentiment Analysis API in Azure AI Language. The solution must ensure that the managed feedback remains on your company’s internal network.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_36.png "Body image")

1. **Provision the Language service resource in Azure**. This step involves creating the Azure Language service resource, which will provide you with the necessary credentials and endpoint URL to use the Sentiment Analysis API.

2. **Deploy a Docker container to an on-premises server**. By deploying a Docker container on-premises, you can run the Sentiment Analysis API locally, ensuring that the feedback data does not leave your internal network.

3. **Run the container and query the prediction endpoint**. Once the container is running on your on-premises server, you can start sending feedback data to the Sentiment Analysis API by querying the prediction endpoint provided by the Language service.

### Question #65


You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure AI Service resource named CSAccount1 and a virtual network named VNet1. CSAaccount1 is connected to VNet1.

You need to ensure that only specific resources can access CSAccount1. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- Prevent external access to CSAccount1.
- Minimize administrative effort.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

- **A. In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1**.

- B. In CSAccount1, configure the Access control (IAM) settings.

- C. In VNet1, modify the virtual network settings.

- D. In VNet1, create a virtual subnet.

- **E. In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings.**

A. **In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1**. This allows you to secure your Azure service resources to the virtual network.

E. **In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings**. This will allow you to configure CSAccount1 to accept connections only from the virtual network VNet1.

Enabling service endpoints and modifying the virtual network settings for the AI Service resource will limit access to the resources within VNet1, effectively fulfilling both requirements.


- A - creating a service endpoint for csaccount1 on vnet1 ensures that its the only way of accessing the service and it ensures a secure connection 
- E - adding network settings on service csaccount1 will ensure that the access is restricted to resources within vnet1

To ensure that only specific resources can access CSAccount1 and prevent external access while minimizing administrative effort, you should perform the following actions:

A. In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1.

E. In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings.

Explanation:

Enable a Service Endpoint for CSAccount1 (Action A):

Service endpoints provide direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network. By enabling a service endpoint for CSAccount1 on VNet1, you ensure that the traffic between VNet1 and CSAccount1 does not go over the internet, enhancing security and meeting the requirement to prevent external access.

Modify the Virtual Network Settings in CSAccount1 (Action E):

Configuring the virtual network settings in CSAccount1 allows you to specify which subnets within VNet1 can access the AI service. This way, can control access at a more granular level and ensure that only specific resources within those subnets can access CSAccount1.

**Box 1: Classification Incorrect Answers:**

An object detection project is for detecting which objects, if any, from a set of candidates are present in an image.

**Box 2: Multiclass -**


A multiclass classification project is for classifying images into a set of tags, or target labels. An image can be assigned to one tag only. Incorrect Answers:

A multilabel classification project is similar, but each image can have multiple tags assigned to it.


The third choice should be **General compact**, in other that the model can be exported to be used in iOS device


- Classification 
- Multiclass 
- General (compact)

### Question #10


You have an Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video Indexer) service that is used to provide a search interface over company videos on your company's website.

You need to be able to search for videos based on who is present in the video.

What should you do?


- **A. Create a person model and associate the model to the videos**.

- B. Create person objects and provide face images for each object.

- C. Invite the entire staff of the company to Video Indexer.

- D. Edit the faces in the videos.

- E. Upload names to a language model.

**Correct Answer: A**

Video Indexer supports multiple Person models per account. Once a model is created, you can use it by providing the model ID of a specific Person model when uploading/indexing or reindexing a video. Training a new face for a video updates the specific custom model that the video was associated with.

Note: Video Indexer supports face detection and celebrity recognition for video content. The celebrity recognition feature covers about one million faces based on commonly requested data source such as IMDB, Wikipedia, and top LinkedIn influencers. Faces that aren't recognized by the celebrity recognition feature are detected but left unnamed. Once you label a face with a name, the face and name get added to your account's Person model. Video Indexer will then recognize this face in your future videos and past videos.\


### Question #11

Note: Given query face's faceId, to search the similar-looking faces from a faceId array, a face list or a large face list. A "faceListId" is created by FaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will not expire. And a "largeFaceListId" is created by LargeFaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will also not expire.

Incorrect Answers:

Not "faceListId": Add a face to a specified face list, up to 1,000 faces.


**Box 2: matchFace**


Find similar has two working modes, "matchPerson" and "matchFace". "matchPerson" is the default mode that it tries to find faces of the same person as possible by using internal same-person thresholds. It is useful to find a known person's other photos. Note that an empty list will be returned if no faces pass the internal thresholds. "matchFace" mode ignores same-person thresholds and returns ranked similar faces anyway, even the similarity is low. It can be used in the cases like searching celebrity-looking faces.


1. LargeFaceListId
2. matchFace

### Question #13

You are developing a photo application that will fiond photos of a person based on a sample image by using the Face API.

	await faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(personGroupId, personId, stream); 
  }
```


### Question #16

Your company uses an Azure Cognitive Services solution to detect faces in uploaded images. The method to detect the faces uses the following code.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_60.png "Body image")

You discover that the solution frequently fails to detect faces in blurred images and in images that contain sideways faces.

You need to increase the likelihood that the solution can detect faces in blurred images and images that contain sideways faces. What should you do?

- A. Use a different version of the Face API.

- B. Use the Computer Vision service instead of the Face service.

- C. Use the Identify method instead of the Detect method.

- **D. Change the detection model**.

**D**

**Evaluate different models.**

The best way to compare the performances of the detection models is to use them on a sample dataset. We recommend calling the Face Detect API on a variety of images, especially images of many faces or of faces that are di®cult to see, using each detection model. Pay attention to the number of faces that each model returns.

The different face detection models are optimized for different tasks. See the following table for an overview of the differences.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_61.png "Body image")

**use `detection_02` or `detection_03`.**

### Question #17 

You have the following Python function for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically. 

```
def create_resource (resource_name, kind, account_tier, location) : 

	parameters = CognitiveServicesAccount(sku=Sku(name=account_tier), kind=kind, location=location, properties={}) 
    	result = client.accounts.create(resource_group_name, resource_name, parameters) 
```
You need to call the function to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

B. create_resource("res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "F0", "westus")

C. create_resource("res1", "ComputerVision", "S0", "westus")

D. create_resource("res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "S0", "westus")
```

**`A. create_resource("res1", "ComputerVision", "F0", "westus")`**


**Computer vision provide automatic vision solutions including captions. The key-phrase is "automatic".**


### Question #18

You are developing a method that uses the Computer Vision client library. The method will perform optical character recognition (OCR) in images. The method has the following code.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_62.png "Body image")

During testing, you discover that the call to the GetReadResultAsync method occurs before the read operation is complete. 

You need to prevent the GetReadResultAsync method from proceeding until the read operation is complete.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


```
A. Remove the operation_id parameter.

B. Add code to verify the read_results.status value.

C. Add code to verify the status of the read_operation_location value.

D. Wrap the call to get_read_result within a loop that contains a delay.
```

- **B. Add code to verify the `read_results.status` value.**

- **D. Wrap the call to `get_read_result` within a loop that contains a delay.**


In order to prevent the GetReadResultAsync method from proceeding until the read operation is complete, we need to check the status of the read operation and wait until it's completed. 


To do this, we can add code to verify the status of the `read_results.status` value. If the status is not "succeeded", we can add a delay and then retry the operation until it's complete. 

**This can be achieved by wrapping the call to `get_read_result` within a loop that contains a delay.**

Removing the `operation_id` parameter or adding code to verify the status of the `read_operation_location` value will not solve the issue of waiting for the read operation to complete before proceeding with the GetReadResultAsync method.


### Question #19

You are building an app that will enable users to upload images. The solution must meet the following requirements: * Automatically suggest alt text for the images.

* Detect inappropriate images and block them.

- **B. optical character recognition (OCR)**

- C. key phrase extraction

- D. document extraction

To ensure that queries can be performed on the contents of the letters, the skill that should be included in the indexer is optical character recognition (OCR).


Option B, optical character recognition (OCR), is a technology that can recognize text within an image and convert it into machine-readable text. This skill will enable the search engine to read the handwritten letters and convert them into searchable text that can be indexed by Azure Cognitive Search.

Option A, image analysis, is a useful skill for analyzing images to extract metadata, but it does not directly enable text recognition.

Option C, key phrase extraction, extracts important phrases and concepts from text, but it requires the text to be already recognized and extracted by OCR or other text extraction techniques.

Option D, document extraction, is a skill that extracts specific pieces of information from documents, but it does not address the challenge of recognizing and extracting text from handwritten letters.

### Question #22

You have a library that contains thousands of images.

You need to tag the images as photographs, drawings, or clipart.

Which service endpoint and response property should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_64.png "Body image")

- 1 - Computer Vision analyze image 

- 2 - imageType

With the Analyze Image API, Computer Vision can analyze the content type of images, indicating whether an image is clip art or a line drawing.

- Service endpoint: Computer Vision image classification 
- Property: imageType

  
The Computer Vision image classification endpoint allows you to classify images into different categories, and the imageType property specifically provides information about the type of image, such as whether it is a photograph, drawing, or clipart.


### Question #23

You have an app that captures live video of exam candidates.

You need to use the Face service to validate that the subjects of the videos are real people.

What should you do?

- A. Call the face detection API and retrieve the face rectangle by using the FaceRectangle attribute.

- **B. Call the face detection API repeatedly and check for changes to the FaceAttributes.HeadPose attribute.**

- C. Call the face detection API and use the FaceLandmarks attribute to calculate the distance between pupils.

- D. Call the face detection API repeatedly and check for changes to the FaceAttributes.Accessories attribute.

**B is the answer.**

You can detect head gestures like nodding and head shaking by tracking HeadPose changes in real time. You can use this feature as a custom liveness detector.

Liveness detection is the task of determining that a subject is a real person and not an image or video representation. A head gesture detector could serve as one way to help verify liveness, especially as opposed to an image representation of a person.

### Question #24

You make an API request and receive the results shown in the following exhibits.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_65.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_66.png "Body image")

Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_67.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_68.png "Body image")

**1. detects**

**2. 797, 201**

Each detected face corresponds to a faceRectangle field in the response. This is a set of pixel coordinates for the left, top, width, and height of th detected face. Using these coordinates, you can get the location and size of the face. In the API response, faces are listed in size order from larges to smallest.


- QualityForRecognition

The overall image quality regarding whether the image being used in the detection is of sufficient quality to attempt face recognition on. The value is an informal rating of low, medium, or high. Only "high" quality images are recommended for person enrollment, and quality at or above "medium" is recommended for identification scenarios.


```
To answer the first question see the endpoint .../face/v1.0/detect?....


To answer the second question see the first object from the response "faceRectangle": {"TOP":201, "LEFT:"797....}
```

### Question #25

You have an Azure subscription that contains an AI enrichment pipeline in Azure Cognitive Search and an Azure Storage account that has 10 GB of scanned documents and images.

You need to index the documents and images in the storage account. The solution must minimize how long it takes to build the index.

What should you do?

- **A. From the Azure portal, configure parallel indexing.**

- B. From the Azure portal, configure scheduled indexing.

- C. Configure field mappings by using the REST API.

- D. Create a text-based indexer by using the REST API.

If you partition your data, you can create multiple indexer-data-source combinations that pull from each data source and write to the same search index. Because each indexer is distinct, you can run them at the same time, populating a search index more quickly than if you ran them sequentially.

### Question #26

You need to analyze video content to identify any mentions of specific company names.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_69.png "Body image")


1. Sign in to Azure Video Analyzer for Media website

2. From Content model customization, select Brands

3. Add specific company names to include list

### Question #27

You have a mobile app that manages printed forms.

You need the app to send images of the forms directly to Forms Recognizer to extract relevant information. For compliance reasons, the image files must not be stored in the cloud.

In which format should you send the images to the Form Recognizer API endpoint?

- **A. raw image binary**

- B. form URL encoded

- C. JSON

**Selected Answer: A**

To send images to the Form Recognizer API endpoint without storing them in the cloud, you should send the images in the following format:

**A. raw image binary**

Sending the images as raw image binary data allows you to transmit the image directly to the Form Recognizer API without the need to store them in the cloud or convert them into other formats. This format ensures compliance with your requirements

### Question #28

You plan to build an app that will generate a list of tags for uploaded images. The app must meet the following requirements:

- Generate tags in a user's preferred language.

- • Support English, French, and Spanish.

Which Azure service endpoint should you use?

- A. Content Moderator Image Moderation

- B. Custom Vision image classification

- **C. Computer Vision Image Analysis**

- D. Custom Translator

**Selected Answer: C**

I think the answer should be C, because of the minimized developement effort. Since the prebuilt model of C also fits the other two requirements, so there is no need to train a custom model.


### Question #29

- Precision: Measures how precise/accurate your model is. It's the ratio between the correctly identified positives (true positives) and all identified positives. The precision metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correctly labeled.

**`Precision = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)`**

- Recall: Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It's the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct. Recall = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)

### Question #32


You are building an app that will include one million scanned magazine articles. Each article will be stored as an image file.

You need to configure the app to extract text from the images. The solution must minimize development effort.

What should you include in the solution?


- A. Computer Vision Image Analysis

- **B. the Read API in Computer Vision**

- C. Form Recognizer

- D. Azure Cognitive Service for Language

**Selected Answer: B**


With the new Image Analysis API 4.0 (in preview) you could use OCR feature too, but as i said, it is in preview. don't think it is considered in the exam.

Instead the Read API is particularly adapted for text-heavy documents and it seems this is the case


A - Computer Vision Image Analysis: This is a service provided by Azure that can extract a wide variety of visual features from your images. It determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces. However, while it does have OCR capabilities, it is not specifically designed for large-scale text extraction from images.

B - Read API in Computer Vision: This is a part of the Azure Computer Vision service that is designed to extract printed and handwritten text images. It uses state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms optimized for text-heavy documents2. This could be a good your needs as it is designed to handle large amounts of text in images.

the key here is option A it is not specifically designed for large-scale text extraction from images.

## Topic 3 - Question Set 3

### Question #1

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You build a language model by using a Language Understanding service. The language model is used to search for information on a contact list by using an intent named FindContact.

A conversational expert provides you with the following list of phrases to use for training.

- ✑ Find contacts in London.

- ✑ Who do I know in Seattle?

- ✑ Search for contacts in Ukraine.

You need to implement the phrase list in Language Understanding.

**Solution: You create a new pattern in the FindContact intent.**

Does this meet the goal?


**A. Yes**

B. No

Using a pattern could be a good solution IMHO... ✑ Find contacts in London.

✑ Who do I know in Seattle?

✑ Search for contacts in Ukraine.


**Like Where is {FormName}[?] Who authored {FormName}[?] {FormName} is published in French[?]**


we could do:

- ✑ Find contacts in {CityOrCountry}.
- ✑ Who do I know in {CityOrCountry}[?] 
- ✑ Search for contacts in {CityOrCountry}[?].

So, to me a pattern is a Solution (A)


> **You create a new intent for location.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes
- **B. No**

The intent is for FindContact, not location really.\

An utterance having wo intents? This is illogical.

The model should have an Entity "Location" that will help in finding the contacts


> **You create a new entity for the domain**.

**Should be YES**

We create a new location entity for domain to keep the location of FindContact intent

The model should have an Entity "Location" that will help in finding the contacts.

### Question #2

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You develop an application to identify species of flowers by training a Custom Vision model.

You receive images of new flower species.

You need to add the new images to the classifier.

Solution: You add the new images, and then use the Smart Labeler tool.

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**


**Correct Answer: B**

**The model need to be extended and retrained.**

Note: Smart Labeler to generate suggested tags for images. This lets you label a large number of images more quickly when training a Custom Vision model.


The answer is B is because the limitations of the smart labeler: You should only request suggested tags for images whose tags have already been trained on once. Don't get suggestions for a new tag that you're just beginning to train. You are given new images of species that have not been seen by the model how can you expect it to suggest what they are? Also you can train the model right in the smart labeler: check the workflow

**Selected Answer: B**

**Smart Labeler will generate suggested tags for images. This lets you label a large number of images more quickly when you're training a Custom Vision model.**

When you tag images for a Custom Vision model, the service uses the latest trained iteration of the model to predict the labels of new images. It shows these predictions as suggested tags, based on the selected confidence threshold and prediction uncertainty. You can then either confirm o change the suggestions, speeding up the process of manually tagging the images for training.

**Solution: You add the new images and labels to the existing model. You retrain the model, and then publish the model.**

Does this meet the goal?

> **Correct Answer: A The model needs to be extended and retrained.**
>
> uploading, tagging, retraining and publishing the model


**Solution: You create a new model, and then upload the new images and labels.**

Does this meet the goal?


Correct Answer: B

The model needs to be extended and retrained.


**Correct. Instead you need to add the new images and labels to the existing model. You retrain the model, and then publish the model**


### Question #5

You are developing a service that records lectures given in English (United Kingdom).

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_85.png "Body image")

**Box 1: {"fr", "de", "es"}**


A common task of speech translation is to specify target translation languages, at least one is required but multiples are supported. The following code snippet sets both French and German as translation language targets. 

```
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync() { 
var translationConfig = SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION); translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "it-IT";

// Translate to languages. See, https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("fr"); translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage("de"); }
```


**Box 2: TranslationRecognizer -**

After you've created a SpeechTranslationConfig, the next step is to initialize a TranslationRecognizer.

```
static async Task TranslateSpeechAsync() { 
	var translationConfig = SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION); 
    var fromLanguage = "en-US"; var toLanguages = new List<string> { "it", "fr", "de" }; 
    translationConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage; toLanguages.ForEach(translationConfig.AddTargetLanguage); 
    using var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(translationConfig); }
```

### Question #11

You run the following command.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_87.png "Body image")

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Yes No Yes**

Log location is not mounted. The ET answer relates to an example provided on the given website which DOES mount a log location.


Going to http://localhost:5000/status will query the Azure endpoint to verify whether the API key used to start the container is valid.

 
Yes. Typically, Azure Cognitive Services containers provide a /status endpoint that can be used to check the status of the service, including the validity of the API key. Since the service is mapped to localhost:5000, accessing this URL should provide the status of the containerized service, including the API key's validity.

The container logging provider will write log data.

No (Assuming). This statement is somewhat ambiguous and depends on the configuration of the Docker container and the Azure Cognitive Services container.

Going to http://localhost:5000/swagger will provide the details to access the documentation for the available endpoints.

Yes. It is a common practice for web services and APIs, including those provided by Azure Cognitive Services, to offer a Swagger UI at a /swagger endpoint.


### Question #12


You are building a Language Understanding model for an e-commerce platform. You need to construct an entity to capture billing addresses.

Which entity type should you use for the billing address?

### Question #15

You have a chatbot that was built by using the Microsoft Bot Framework.

You need to debug the chatbot endpoint remotely.

Which two tools should you install on a local computer? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. Fiddler

- B. Bot Framework Composer

- **C. Bot Framework Emulator**

- D. Bot Framework CLI

- **E. ngrok**

- F. nginx

**CE**


Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots, either locally or remotely. ngrok is a cross-platform application that "allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet." Essentially, what we'll be doing is using ngrok to forward messages from external channels on the web directly to our local machine to allow debugging, as opposed to the standard messaging endpoint configured in the Azure portal.


C. Bot Framework Emulator: This is an essential tool for debugging Microsoft Bot Framework bots. It allows you to test and debug your bots on your local machine by emulating the Bot Framework's channels and activities. It can be very helpful in a local development environment but is les suited for remote debugging.

E. ngrok: ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to your localhost. This is very useful for remote debugging because it allows you to expose your local development server to the internet, which is necessary for testing and debugging interactions with services like the Microsoft Bot Framework.

### Question #16

You are building a retail chatbot that will use a QnA Maker service.

You upload an internal support document to train the model. The document contains the following question: "What is your warranty period?" Users report that the chatbot returns the default QnA Maker answer when they ask the following question: "How long is the warranty coverage?" The chatbot returns the correct answer when the users ask the following question: 'What is your warranty period?" Both questions should return the same answer.

You need to increase the accuracy of the chatbot responses.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_89.png "Body image")

Add alternate questions to an existing QnA pair to improve the likelihood of a match to a user query. 


**Step 2: Retrain the model.**

Periodically select Save and train after making edits to avoid losing changes.

**Step 3: Republish the model Note:** 

A knowledge base consists of question and answer (QnA) pairs. Each pair has one answer and a pair contains all the information associated with that answer.


1. Add alternative phrasing to the QnA pair.
2. Retrain model.
3. Republish model.


### Question #17

You are training a Language Understanding model for a user support system. 

You create the first intent named GetContactDetails and add 200 examples. 

You need to decrease the likelihood of a false positive.

What should you do?


A. Enable active learning.

B. Add a machine learned entity.

C. Add additional examples to the GetContactDetails intent.

**D. Add examples to the None intent.**

You should also consider adding false positive examples to the None intent."

**False positive means =>**

The model needs examples of what it should not classify as "GetContactDetails," which is the role of the "None" intent.

Therefore, the most effective approach is to add a diverse range of examples to the "None" intent, covering various phrases and queries that are outside the scope of "GetContactDetails." 

This helps create a clear boundary for the model, reducing the likelihood of it mistakenly classifying unrelated inputs as belonging to the "GetContactDetails" intent


### **Question #20**

You are building a Language Understanding model for purchasing tickets.

C: Need a blob indexer.

Note: A blob indexer is used for ingesting content from Azure Blob storage into a Cognitive Search index.


Index large datasets Indexing blobs can be a time-consuming process. In cases where you have millions of blobs to index, you can speed up indexing by partitioning your data and using multiple indexers to process the data in parallel. Here's how you can set this up:

- ✑ Partition your data into multiple blob containers or virtual folders 

- ✑ Set up several data sources, one per container or folder.

- ✑ Create a corresponding indexer for each data source. All of the indexers should point to the same target search index.

- ✑ One search unit in your service can run one indexer at any given time. Creating multiple indexers as described above is only useful if they actually run in parallel.

### Question #4

**Selected Answer: ABE**

Correct Answer: ABE

Defining a table projection.

Each table requires three properties:

✑ tableName: The name of the table in Azure Storage.

✑ generatedKeyName: The column name for the key that uniquely identifies this row.

✑ source: The node from the enrichment tree you are sourcing your enrichments from. This node is usually the output of a shaper, but could be the output of any of the skills.

- A. tableName: Necessary for defining where the output data should be stored.

- B. generatedKeyName: Important for scenarios requiring unique identification of rows, though its necessity can vary.

- E. source: Essential for specifying the input data that will be processed and projected into the table.

**Therefore, the correct answers are A (tableName), B (generatedKeyName), and E (source), as they play direct roles in the configuration of a table projection within a skillset for Azure Cognitive Search.**


### Question #5

- D. entities/recognition/general

The key phrases provide us with the important words from our customer comments, not just the most common words. Also, word sizing in the resulting cloud isn't skewed by the frequent use of a word in a relatively small number of comments.

The best choice for this scenario is **A. keyPhrases**. This endpoint extracts the main points or topics from a text document, which can be used to generate a word cloud that shows the most frequent or relevant terms in the reviews. The other endpoints are not suitable for this task because:

- B. sentiment analyzes the positive, negative, or neutral tone of a text document, which is not relevant for generating a word cloud.

- C. languages detects the language of a text document, which is not relevant for generating a word cloud.

- D. entities/recognition/general identifies and categorizes named entities in a text document, such as person names, locations, organizations, etc This might not capture the main points or topics of the reviews, and might include irrelevant or sensitive information in the word cloud.


### Question #9

Method invoked when a conversation update activity that indicates one or more users other than the bot are joining the conversation

### Question #9

You are reviewing the design of a chatbot. The chatbot includes a language generation file that contains the following fragment.

```
# Greet(user) 

- ${Greeting()}, ${user.name}
```

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_157.png "Body image")

**COrrect answer is : NYY**

**`${user.name}` retrieves the user's name using a prompt.-->No.**

In this context, ${user.name} directly retrieves the user's name from the incoming user object. It doesn't obtain the user's name through a prompt but assumes that the user object already contains the name property.


**`Greet()` is the name of the language generation template.-->Yes.**

Greet(user) defines a language generation template named Greet. This template takes a user parameter, indicating that Greet is the template name used to generate personalized greeting messages.


**`${Greeting()}` is a reference to a template in the language generation file.-->Yes.**

`${Greeting()}` is a reference to another template in the language generation file. This syntax indicates that Greeting is a template that will be invoked to generate all or part of a greeting when messages are generated. This allows developers to reuse and combine templates in the language generation file to create more complex messages.

### Question #10

You are building a chatbot by using the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK.


You use an object named UserProfile to store user profile information and an object named ConversationData to store information related to a conversation.

You create the following state accessors to store both objects in state. 

```
var userStateAccessors = _userState.CreateProperty<UserProfile> (nameof(UserProfile)); var conversationStateAccessors = _conversationState.CreateProperty<ConversationData>(nameof(ConversationData)); 
```

The state storage mechanism is set to Memory Storage.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_158.png "Body image")

**YYN is the answer.**

**Box 1: Yes**

You create property accessors using the CreateProperty method that provides a handle to the BotState object. Each state property accessor allows you to get or set the value of the associated state property.

**Box 2: Yes -**

**Box 3: No**

Before you exit the turn handler, you use the state management objects' SaveChangesAsync() method to write all state changes back to storage.

State property accessors are used to actually read or write one of your state properties, and provide get, set, and delete methods for accessing your state properties from within a turn. To create an accessor, you must provide the property name, which usually takes place when you're initializing your bot. Then, you can use that accessor to get and manipulate that property of your bot's state.

The accessors allow the SDK to get state from the underlying storage, and update the bot's state cache for you. The state cache is a local cache maintained by your bot that stores the state object for you, allowing read and write operations without accessing the underlying storage. If it isn't already in the cache, calling the accessor's get method retrieves state and also places it in the cache. Once retrieved, the state property can be manipulated just like a local variable.

**SelectItem** is the **intent**, and each item below it are example utterances that capture ways users can express this intent. 

Entities in .lu files are denoted using {<entityName>=<labeled value>} notation. Taking from our sample code once again, you can find the bottom left entity within the following utterance: choose the {DirectionalReference=bottom left}.


1. intent

2. utterance

**sample-utterances**

Intents with their sample utterances are declared in the following way:

```

- **B. No**

### Question #27

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You have a chatbot that uses question answering in Azure Cognitive Service for Language.

Users report that the responses of the chatbot lack formality when answering spurious questions.

You need to ensure that the chatbot provides formal responses to spurious questions.

**Solution: From Language Studio, you modify the question and answer pairs for the custom intents, and then retrain and republish the model.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

The formality of responses to spurious questions is not controlled by modifying the question and answer pairs for the custom intents in Language Studio. These pairs are used to train the model to understand and respond to specific intents, not to control the tone or formality of the responses.

To ensure that the chatbot provides formal responses to spurious questions, you would need to adjust the chatbot's response templates or script not the question and answer pairs for the custom intents. This might involve programming the chatbot to use more formal language in its responses, or to respond to unrecognized or spurious inputs with a standard, formal message

### Question #28

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You have a chatbot that uses question answering in Azure Cognitive Service for Language.

PDF file use for training, it is not rationale.


**Solution: From Language Studio, you create an entity for price, and then retrain and republish the model.**

Does this meet the goal?

A. Yes

**B. No**

here the issue is not the price that could be an entity, but very different utterances that need to be considered

### Question #33

You have a Conversational Language Understanding model.

You export the model as a JSON file. The following is a sample of the file.



![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_173.png "Body image")

What represents the Weather.Historic entity in the sample utterance?


- A. last year

- **B. by month**

- C. amount of

- D. average

**Selected Answer: B**

### Question #34

You are building a chatbot by using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer.


You need to configure the chatbot to present a list of available options. The solution must ensure that an image is provided for each option.

Which two features should you use? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- A. an entity

- B. an Azure function

- C. an utterance

- **D. an adaptive card**

- **E. a dialog**

To configure the chatbot to present a list of available options with images, you should use the following features:

D. An adaptive card: Adaptive cards are a flexible, customizable way to present rich, interactive content within a chatbot conversation. You can use adaptive cards to display a list of available options, along with images and other interactive elements, such as buttons or inputs.

E. A dialog: Dialogs are used to manage and organize the conversation flow in your chatbot. You can create a dialog that is responsible for presenting the list of available options using an adaptive card. The dialog can be triggered when needed, and it can handle the user's selection of an option.


**DE is the answer.**

Modern conversational software has many different components. Bot Framework Composer integrates these pieces into dialogs, a single interface for constructing the building blocks of bot functionality.

Each dialog represents a portion of the bot's functionality and contains instructions for how the bot will react to the input. Dialogs can include custom business logic, calls to cloud APIs, training data for language processing systems, and importantly, the actual content used in conversation with the bot's end users. Simple bots will have just a few dialogs. Sophisticated bots might have dozens or hundreds of individual dialogs.

### Question #35

You are building a chatbot.

You need to configure the bot to guide users through a product setup process.

Which type of dialog should you use?

A. component

B. action

**C. waterfall**

### Question #36

You have a chatbot that was built by using Microsoft Bot Framework and deployed to Azure.

You need to configure the bot to support voice interactions. The solution must support multiple client apps.

Which type of channel should you use?


A. Cortana

B. Microsoft Teams

**C. Direct Line Speech**

**C is the answer.**

The Bot Framework offers multiple channels with the Direct Line branding. It's important that you select the version that best fits the conversational AI experience you're designing.

Direct Line Speech. It provides text-to-speech and speech-to-text services within the channel. It allows a client to stream audio directly to the channel which will then be converted to text and sent to the bot. Direct Line Speech can also convert text messages from the bot into audio messages spoken by an AI-powered voice. Combined, this makes Direct Line Speech capable of having audio only conversations with clients.

### Question #37

You are building a bot by using Microsoft Bot Framework.

You need to configure the bot to respond to spoken requests. The solution must minimize development effort.

What should you do?

- **A. Deploy the bot to Azure and register the bot with a Direct Line Speech channel**.

- B. Integrate the bot with Cortana by using the Bot Framework SDK.

- C. Create an Azure function that will call the Speech service and connect the bot to the function.

- D. Deploy the bot to Azure and register the bot with a Microsoft Teams channel.

A. Deploy the bot to Azure and register the bot with a Direct Line Speech channel.

To enable the bot to respond to spoken requests with minimal development effort, you should deploy the bot to Azure and register the bot with a Direct Line Speech channel. Direct Line Speech provides an integrated speech and bot experience without requiring additional development. It combines both the speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with the bot's logic to handle spoken requests and generate spoken responsese

### Question #38

### Question #42

You have a chatbot.

You need to ensure that the bot conversation resets if a user fails to respond for 10 minutes.

How should you complete the code? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_175.png "Body image")

1. `send_activity`

2. `clear_state`

```
# Notify the user that the conversation is being restarted.

- await turn_context.send_activity( # Clear state.

- await self.conversation_state.clear_state(turn_context)
```

### Question #43

You develop a Conversational Language Understanding model by using Language Studio.

During testing, users receive incorrect responses to requests that do NOT relate to the capabilities of the model.

You need to ensure that the model identifies spurious requests.

What should you do?

- A. Enable active learning.

- B. Add entities.

- **C. Add examples to the None intent.**

- D. Add examples to the custom intents.

**Selected Answer: C**

The None intent is also treated like any other intent in your project. If there are utterances that you want predicted as None, consider adding similar examples to them in your training data. For example, if you would like to categorize utterances that are not important to your project as None, such as greetings, yes and no answers, responses to questions such as providing a number, then add those utterances to your intent.

You should also consider adding false positive examples to the None intent. For example, in a flight booking project it is likely that the utterance "I want to buy a book" could be confused with a Book Flight intent. Adding "I want to buy a book" or "I love reading books" as None training utterances helps alter the predictions of those types of utterances towards the None intent instead of Book Flight.

### Question #44

You have a Speech resource and a bot that was built by using the Microsoft Bot Framework Composer.

You need to add support for speech-based channels to the bot.

Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A. Configure the language and voice settings for the Speech resource**.

- **B. Add the endpoint and key of the Speech resource to the bot**.

- C. Add language understanding to dialogs.

- D. Add Orchestrator to the bot.

- **E. Add Speech to the bot responses**.

- F. Remove the setSpeak configuration.

To add support for speech-based channels to a bot built with the Microsoft Bot Framework Composer, you should perform the following actions

Add the endpoint and key of the Speech resource to the bot (B): You need to configure the bot to connect to the Speech resource, which will enable the bot to convert text into speech and vice versa.

Add Speech to the bot responses (E): You should update your bot's responses to include speech output. This is important for speech-based channels, as the bot will need to generate spoken responses for users.

Configure the language and voice settings for the Speech resource (A): Configuring the language and voice settings in your Speech resource important to ensure that the speech output is generated in the desired language and with the appropriate voice.

The other options (C, D, and F) are not directly related to adding support for speech-based channels and can be considered unrelated to this specific task. 

**A. Configure the language and voice settings for the Speech resource.**

This step is crucial for ensuring that the Speech service can accurately recognize and synthesize speech in the desired language and voice.

**B. Add the endpoint and key of the Speech resource to the bot.**

To use the Azure Speech service with your bot, you need to authenticate your requests.

**E. Add Speech to the bot responses.**

To enhance the bot’s interactions over speech-based channels, you should include speech-specific responses.

### Question #45

You are building a bot.

You need to test the bot in the Bot Framework Emulator. The solution must ensure that you can debug the bot interactively.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_176.png "Body image")

1. In code, create new trace activity

2. In code, send a trace activity

3. Run bot app on local host

A trace activity is an activity that your bot can send to the Bot Framework Emulator. You can use trace activities to interactively debug a bot, as the allow you to view information about your bot while it runs locally.

Trace activities are sent only to the Emulator and not to any other client or channel. The Emulator displays them in the log but not the main chat panel.

In order to see a trace activity in the Emulator, you need a scenario in which your bot will send a trace activity, such as throwing an exception and sending a trace activity from the adapter's on turn error handler.

**To send a trace activity from your bot**

- Create a new activity.

- Create a new activity.

**To view a trace activity in the Emulator:**

You need to deploy the Azure AI Anomaly Detector to Server1.

Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_182.png "Body image")

1. Install

2. From pull

3. From run

4. Query

## Topic 7 - Question Set 7

### Question #1

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains an Azure OpenAI resource that hosts a GPT-4 model named Model1 and an app named App1. App1 uses Model1.

You need to ensure that App1 will NOT return answers that include hate speech.

What should you configure for Model1?

A. the Frequency penalty parameter

B. abuse monitoring

**C. a content filter**

D. the Temperature parameter


### Question #2

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains an Azure OpenAI resource that hosts a GPT-3.5 Turbo model named Model1.

You configure Model1 to use the following system message: “You are an AI assistant that helps people solve mathematical puzzles. Explain your answers as if the request is by a 4-year-old.”

Which type of prompt engineering technique is this an example of?

A. few-shot learning

B. affordance

C. chain of thought

**D. priming**

Priming is utilised in this example because it involves setting up the context or role of the AI model explicitly in a system message. It instructs the model about its role (“You are an AI assistant that helps people solve mathematical puzzles.") and also provides directions about how it should respond ("Explain your answers as if the requestor is a 4-year-old."). This essentially 'primes' the model for the conversation, as it lets the model know the expected behavior and persona that it needs to take on throughout the dialogue.

### Question #3

### Question #4

You are building a chatbot for a travel agent. The chatbot will use the Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5 model and will be used to make travel reservations.

You need to maximize the accuracy of the responses from the chatbot.

What should you do?

**A. Configure the model to include data from the travel agent's database.**

B. Set the Top P parameter for the model to 0.

C. Set the Temperature parameter for the model to 0.

D. Modify the system message used by the model to specify that the answers must be accurate.

**Selected Answer: A**

Configuring the model to include data from the travel agent’s database would allow the chatbot to access a source of relevant and specific information, which can significantly improve the accuracy of its responses. Fine-tuning the model with data specific to travel agent’s services and customer interactions can lead to more precise and contextually appropriate answers.

A system message is designed to give the model instructions, perspective from which to answer, and other helpful information.

It might include, Personality, Tone, Topics to exclude, and specifics such as formatting of answer.

It does NOTHING for accuracy - that is purely incumbent on the training data.


### Question #5

You build a chatbot that uses the Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5 model.

You need to improve the quality of the responses from the chatbot. The solution must minimize development effort.

What are two ways to achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

- A. Fine-tune the model.

- **B. Provide grounding content**.

- **C. Add sample request/response pairs**.

- D. Retrain the language model by using your own data.

- E. Train a custom large language model (LLM).

1. Provide grounding content: This involves feeding the chatbot with relevant domain-specific information and data. This can include documents, articles, FAQs, or any other content related to the chatbot's purpose. By providing this context, the chatbot can better understand the user's intent and respond in a more relevant and informative way.

2. Add sample request/response pairs: This technique involves providing the chatbot with a set of pre-defined questions and their corresponding answers. This helps the chatbot learn the conversation patterns and phrasing related to its specific domain. By analyzing these examples, the chatbot can improve its ability to generate natural and consistent responses to user queries.

Both options (A. Provide grounding content and C. Add sample request/response pairs) achieve the goal of improving response quality with minimal development effort, as they do not require extensive retraining or model building.


Therefore, the two correct answers are:

**B. Provide grounding content**.

**C. Add sample request/response pairs.**

### Question #6

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure OpenAI resource named AI1.

You build a chatbot that will use AI1 to provide generative answers to specific questions.

### Question #9

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure OpenAI resource.

You configure a model that has the following settings:

• Temperature: 1

• Top probabilities: 0.5

• Max response tokens: 100

You ask the model a question and receive the following response.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_189.png "Body image")


For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_190.png "Body image")

**No No No**

**N - the subscription is NOT charged for 86 tokens** - the response does not contain 86 tokens. For reference, each token is roughly four characters for typical English text.

**N - text completion is clearly under 86 and the sentence is not truncated.** the finish_reason here is "stop". If the prompt had been cut off, the finish_reason would have been 'length' N - max tokens is the maximum number to generate in the COMPLETION.

The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).

**N/N/N**

- Subscriptions are charged for both the prompt and completion tokens.

- Completion tokens is less than max response tokens.

- It refers to max response tokens only, not max tokens.

#### Question

You are developing the smart e-commerce project.

You need to implement autocompletion as part of the Cognitive Search solution.

Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


**A. Make API queries to the autocomplete endpoint and include suggesterName in the body.**

**B. Add a suggester that has the three product name fields as source fields.**

C. Make API queries to the search endpoint and include the product name fields in the searchFields query parameter.

D. Add a suggester for each of the three product name fields.

E. Set the searchAnalyzer property for the three product name variants.

**F. Set the analyzer property for the three product name variants.**

A: Call a suggester-enabled query, in the form of a Suggestion request or Autocomplete request, using an API. API usage is illustrated in the following call to the Autocomplete REST API.

```
POST /indexes/myxboxgames/docs/autocomplete?search&api-version=2020-06-30 { "search": "minecraf", "suggesterName": "sg" }
```

B: In Azure Cognitive Search, typeahead or "search-as-you-type" is enabled through a suggester. A suggester provides a list of fields that undergo additional tokenization, generating prefix sequences to support matches on partial terms. For example, a suggester that includes a City field with a value for "Seattle" will have prefix combinations of "sea", "seat", "seatt", and "seattl" to support typeahead.

F. Use the default standard Lucene analyzer ("analyzer": null) or a language analyzer (for example, "analyzer": "en.Microsoft") on the field.


**Eliminate the wrong answers:**

C. Make API queries to the search endpoint and include the product name fields in the searchFields query parameter. - as we need autocomplete endpoint, we rule this one out as this is for a search endpoint

D. Add a suggester for each of the three product name fields. - we cannot have 3 suggesters.

E. Set the searchAnalyzer property for the three product name variants. - searchAnalyzer helps in search not in autocomplete.

Step 1: Create a new project and load sample documents Create a new project. Projects store your configurations and settings.

Step 2: Label the sample documents When you create or open a project, the main tag editor window opens.

Step 3: Train a custom model.

#### Question

You are developing the knowledgebase.

You use Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video indexer) to obtain transcripts of webinars. You need to ensure that the solution meets the knowledgebase requirements.

What should you do?

**A. Create a custom language model**

B. Configure audio indexing for videos only

C. Enable multi-language detection for videos

D. Build a custom Person model for webinar presenters

**Keyword "jargon" so choose "A. Create a custom language model" .**

Azure Video Indexer supports automatic speech recognition through integration with the Microsoft Custom Speech Service. You can customize the Language model by uploading adaptation text, namely text from the domain whose vocabulary you'd like the engine to adapt to. Once you train your model, new words appearing in the adaptation text will be recognized, assuming default pronunciation, and the Language model will learn new probable sequences of words.


#### Question

Which expression should you use to trigger a manual review of the extracted information by a member of the Consultant-Bookkeeper group?

A. documentResults.docType == "prebuilt:receipt"

**B. documentResults.fields.*.confidence < 0.7**

C. documentResults.fields.ReceiptType.confidence > 0.7

D. documentResults.fields.MerchantName.confidence < 0.7

**Correct Answer: B**

Need to specify the field name, and then use < 0.7 to handle trigger if confidence score is less than 70%.

Scenario:

✑ AI solution responses must have a confidence score that is equal to or greater than 70 percent.

✑ When the response confidence score of an AI response is lower than 70 percent the response must be improved by human input

#### Question

You are developing the document processing workflow.

You need to identify which API endpoints to use to extract text from the financial documents. The solution must meet the document processing requirements.

Which two API endpoints should you identify? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. /vision/v3.1/read/analyzeResults

**B. /formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models/{modelId}/analyze**

**C. /formrecognizer/v2.0/prebuilt/receipt/analyze**

D. /vision/v3.1/describe

E. /vision/v3.1/read/analyze


**Selected Answer: BC**

B and C are correct as they are part of Azure Form Recognizer.

To meet Contoso’s document processing requirements for standardized financial documents, consider the following two API endpoints:

/formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models/{modelId}/analyze: This endpoint is ideal for extracting information from financial documents. It allows yo to analyze custom models specifically designed for invoices and receipts. With this API, you can extract both tables and text from documents that adhere to distinct standards for each office1.

/formrecognizer/v2.0/prebuilt/receipt/analyze: Designed for receipt analysis, this endpoint simplifies the extraction of relevant data from receipt images. It’s well-suited for handling financial paperwork in PDF or JPEG formats, especially when dealing with documents containing fewer than 2 pages1.

**By utilizing these endpoints, you can efficiently process financial documents, extract essential information, and enhance your document processing workflow.**

**B for customization C for prebuilt receipt with minimum efforts**

**B - Members of a group named Management-Bookkeeper must define how to extract tables from the financial documents** 

**C - Extract text for "receipt" images**

#### Question

You are developing the knowledgebase by using Azure Cognitive Search.

You need to build a skill that will be used by indexers.

How should you complete the code? 

To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_219.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_220.png "Body image")

the Entity Recognition skill is now discontinued replaced by **Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkill**.

Also categories will only allow "Person" as valid category type - not "Persons".

**This (old) version allows output to be either "entities" or "namedEntities" New version only allows "namedEntities" from answer list.**

#### Question

You are developing the knowledgebase by using Azure Cognitive Search. 

You need to process wiki content to meet the technical requirements. 

What should you include in the solution?

A. an indexer for Azure Blob storage attached to a skillset that contains the language detection skill and the text translation skill

B. an indexer for Azure Blob storage attached to a skillset that contains the language detection skill

C. an indexer for Azure Cosmos DB attached to a skillset that contains the document extraction skill and the text translation skill

**D. an indexer for Azure Cosmos DB attached to a skillset that contains the language detection skill and the text translation skill**

**Selected Answer: D**

Document extraction skill only works for files. It's less likely to work with CosmoDB.

**Selected Answer: D**

The correct answer is D. Use an indexer connected to Azure Cosmos DB that includes language detection and text translation skills. This solution meets the requirement for handling multiple languages and supports content transformation for English, French, and Portuguese by using the tex translation skill, which aligns with the technical requirement for multilingual support. Additionally, using Azure Cosmos DB and associated skill set ensures content security and role-based access control (RBAC), meeting the requirements for content approval and security.

#### Question

You are developing the knowledgebase by using Azure Cognitive Search.

You need to meet the knowledgebase requirements for searching equivalent terms. What should you include in the solution?

- **A. synonym map**

- B. a suggester

- C. a custom analyzer

- D. a built-in key phrase extraction skill

**Correct Answer: A**

Within a search service, synonym maps are a global resource that associate equivalent terms, expanding the scope of a query without the user having to actually provide the term. For example, assuming "dog", "canine", and "puppy" are mapped synonyms, a query on "canine" will match on a document containing "dog".

Create synonyms: A synonym map is an asset that can be created once and used by many indexes.

**Selected Answer: A**

Quote "In Azure Cognitive Search, a synonym map contains a list of rules for expanding or rewriting a search query to equivalent terms."


### Question

You are developing the chatbot.

You create the following components:

- ✑ A QnA Maker resource 
- ✑ A chatbot by using the Azure Bot Framework SDK

You need to integrate the components to meet the chatbot requirements. Which property should you use?


A. QnAMakerOptions.StrictFilters

B. QnADialogResponseOptions.CardNoMatchText

C. QnAMakerOptions.RankerType

**D. QnAMakerOptions.ScoreThreshold**

**Answer should be D. QnAMakerOptions.ScoreThreshold**

Technical Requirements says "AI solution responses must have a confidence score that is equal to or greater than 70 percent" and "When the response confidence score is low, ensure that the chatbot can provide other response options to the customers"

### Question

You are developing the chatbot.

You create the following components:

- ✑ A QnA Maker resource 
- ✑ A chatbot by using the Azure Bot Framework SDK 


You need to add an additional component to meet the technical requirements and the chatbot requirements. What should you add?


A. Microsoft Translator

**B. Language Understanding**

C. Orchestrator

D. chatdown


**B. Language Understanding Explanation:**


To meet the requirement that the chatbot must support English, French, and Portuguese and provide other response options when the response confidence score is low, the Language Understanding component (often referred to as LUIS - Language Understanding Intelligent Service) is needed. LUIS allows the bot to understand the user's intent in multiple languages and can help to provide alternative responses.

Microsoft Translator could translate between languages, but it does not handle intent understanding, so it's not the best choice here. Orchestrator is more about managing multiple LUIS and QnA Maker models, which isn't specified in the requirements. Chatdown is a tool for creating mockup of chatbot conversations but doesn't provide the functionality needed to meet the requirements.
