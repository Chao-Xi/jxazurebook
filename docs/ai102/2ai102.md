- ✑ Web Search


PUT: 

- puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI.
- If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.
- If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one.

**POST: POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request.**

### Question #6

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website.

**You plan to monitor the sales system to ensure that it provides equitable results regardless of the user's location or background.**

Which two responsible AI principles provide guidance to meet the monitoring requirements? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. transparency
- **B. fairness**  ✅
- **C. inclusiveness**  ✅
- D. reliability and safety
- E. privacy and security


Correct Answer: BC

- AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- AI systems should perform reliably and safely.


**Fairness** is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle is even more important when AI systems are being
developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or
religion bias toward a group or individual.


**Inclusiveness** mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand
and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition
technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other impairments.


### Question #7

You plan to use containerized versions of the Anomaly Detector API on local devices for testing and in on-premises datacenters.

You need to ensure that the containerized deployments meet the following requirements:

- ✑ Prevent billing and API information from being stored in the command-line histories of the devices that run the container.
- ✑ Control access to the container images by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).


Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and
arrange them in the correct order.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_7.png "Body image")

1. Create a custom docker file
2. Pull the container image (in the dockerfile)
3. Build the image
4. Push to ACR


### Question #8

You plan to deploy a containerized version of an Azure Cognitive Services service that will be used for text analysis.

You configure **https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com** as the endpoint URI for the service, and you pull the latest version of the Text Analytics Sentiment Analysis container.

You need to run the container on an Azure virtual machine by using Docker.

How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_8.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_9.png "Body image")

```
Box 1: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment

To run the Sentiment Analysis v3 container, execute the following docker run command. 

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus \ 
	mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
	Eula=accept \
	Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
	ApiKey={API_KEY} 

is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API. https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com


Box 2: https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com

{ENDPOINT_URI} is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API: https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.a The endpoint for
accessing the Text
```


### Question #9

You have the following C# method for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_10.png "Body image")

You need to call the method to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

Which code should you use?

```
A. create_resource(client, "res", "ComputerVision", "FO", "westus")
B. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision Prediction", "FO", "westus")
C. create_resource(client, "res1", "ComputerVision", "SO", "westus")
D. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "SO", "westus")
```


**A, as there is free tier available for Computer Vision service.**

- Free - Web/Container
- 20 per minute
- 5,000 free transactions per month

The ComputerVision resource is more commonly used because it comes with pre-built capabilities for image analysis, including caption generation, without the need to train a custom model. 

On the other hand, the CustomVision.Prediction you must be specifically trained to support generating captions


### Question #10

You successfully run the following HTTP request.

```
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/18c51a87-3a69-47a8-aedc-a54745f708a1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/contoso1/regenerateKey?api-version=2017-04-18
Body{"keyName": "Key2"}
```


What is the result of the request?


- A. A key for Azure Cognitive Services was generated in Azure Key Vault.
- B. A new query key was generated.
- C. The primary subscription key and the secondary subscription key were rotated.
- **D. The secondary subscription key was reset**.   ✅

This response is indicated by the "keyName": "Key2" in the request body, specifying that the secondary subscription key (Key2) should be regenerated.

> B is wrong. Query key is for search service. The Rest request of create query key is like POST

The request is to the Azure Management API to regenerate a key for an Azure Cognitive Services account (contoso1). The body of the request
specifies {"keyName": "Key2"}, which indicates that the operation is targeted at the secondary subscription key (commonly referred to as Key2 in Azure Cognitive Services management). The regenerateKey action causes the specified key to be reset, generating a new key value for it while invalidating the old one.

### Question #11

You build a custom Form Recognizer model.

You receive sample ¬les to use for training the model as shown in the following table

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_11.png "Body image")

Which three ¬les can you use to train the model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. File1**

- B. File2

- **C. File3**

- D. File4

- E. File5

- **F. File6**


**ACF**


Form Recognizer works on input documents that meet these requirements:

Format must be JPG, PNG, PDF (text or scanned), or TIFF. Text-embedded PDFs are best because there's no possibility of error in character extraction and location.

**File size must be less than 50 MB.**


**File 2 and 5 are excluded.**

New service limits now goes up to 500MB so...

File 1, 3, and 6 are correct for "training the model", however if MSFT remove the word "training" from the question - be careful.

For custom model training the total size is still 50MB. Answer is correct

A. File1 (PDF)

C. File3 (JPG)

F. File6 (JPG)


### Question #12

A customer uses Azure Cognitive Search.

The customer plans to enable a server-side encryption and use customer-managed keys (CMK) stored in Azure. What are three implications of the planned change? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. The index size will increase.**

- **B. Query times will increase**.

- C. A self-signed X.509 certi¬cate is required.

- D. The index size will decrease.

- E. Query times will decrease.

- **F. Azure Key Vault is required**.


**Should be ABF (use AKV for customer managed key)**


"Customer-managed keys require an additional billable service, Azure Key Vault, which can be in a different region, but under the same subscription, as Azure Cognitive Search. Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance."

 
A. The index size will increase. Enabling CMK encryption increases the index size1.

B. Query times will increase. Enabling CMK encryption degrades query performance. You can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times1.

F. Azure Key Vault is required. CMK encryption depends on Azure Key Vault. You can create your own encryption keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use Azure Key Vault APIs to generate encryption keys1


### Question #13

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website. You plan to notify users that their data has been processed by the sales system.

Which responsible AI principle does this help meet?

- **A. transparency**

- B. fairness

- C. inclusiveness

- D. reliability and safety

The correct answer is A, transparency: "When an AI application relies on personal data, such as a facial recognition system that takes images of people to recognize them; you should make it clear to the user how their data is used and retained, and who has access to it."


- "Transparency: AI systems should be understandable."


- "Reliability and safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely."

### Question #14


Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint to a new virtual network, and you con¬gure Azure Private Link.

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

The Azure Private Link should use a private endpoint, not a public endpoint.

Private Link service can be accessed from approved private endpoints in any public region.


Answer is no. you should create a private link with private endpoint


### Question #15

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

Solution: **You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you configure an IP firewall rule.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**
  
**Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.**

The answer is B because the traffic should not be routed over internet. 

"By default, Azure AI Search is configured to allow connections over a public endpoint. Access to a search service through the public endpoint is protected by authentication and authorization protocols, but the endpoint itself is open to the internet at the network layer for data plane requests."


### Question #16

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you con¬gure a network security group (NSG) for vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you con¬gure Azure Private Link.

###  Question #17

You plan to perform predictive maintenance.


You collect IoT sensor data from 100 industrial machines for a year. Each machine has 50 different sensors that generate data at one-minute intervals. In total, you have 5,000 time series datasets.

You need to identify unusual values in each time series to help predict machinery failures.

Which Azure service should you use?

- **A. Anomaly Detector**

- B. Cognitive Search

- C. Form Recognizer

- D. Custom Vision

A is the answer.

Anomaly Detector is an AI service with a set of APIs, which enables you to monitor and detect anomalies in your time series data with little machine learning (ML) knowledge, either batch validation or real-time inference.


### Question #18

You are developing a streaming Speech to Text solution that will use the Speech SDK and MP3 encoding. You need to develop a method to convert speech to text for streaming MP3 data.

2. SpeechRecognizer


### Question #19


You are developing an internet-based training solution for remote learners.

Your company identi¬es that during the training, some learners leave their desk for long periods or become distracted.


You need to use a video and audio feed from each learner's computer to detect whether the learner is present and paying attention. The solution must minimize development effort and identify each learner.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use for each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_14.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_15.png "Body image")


1. Face
2. Face
3. Speech

- From Video feed - Face 
- Facial Expression from - Face 
- Audio Feed is - Speech


### Question #20

You plan to provision a QnA Maker service in a new resource group named RG1.

In RG1, you create an App Service plan named AP1.

Which two Azure resources are automatically created in RG1 when you provision the QnA Maker service? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. Language Understanding

- B. Azure SQL Database

- C. Azure Storage

- **D. Azure Cognitive Search**

- **E. Azure App Service**

"When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the data in your own Azure subscription. Azure Search is used to index your data." & "When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the runtime in your own Azure subscription. App Service is the compute engine that runs the QnA Maker queries for you."


### Question #21

You are building a language model by using a Language Understanding (classic) service. 

You create a new Language Understanding (classic) resource.

You need to add more contributors

What should you use?

- A. a conditional access policy in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

- **B. the Access control (IAM) page for the authoring resources in the Azure portal**

- C. the Access control (IAM) page for the prediction resources in the Azure portal

B is the answer.

In the Azure portal, find your Language Understanding (LUIS) authoring resource. It has the type LUIS.Authoring. In the resource's Access Control (IAM) page, add the role of contributor for the user that you want to contribute.

### Question #22

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

**Using a higher tier does not imply scaling replicas or partitions.**


### Question #23

You need to develop an automated call handling system that can respond to callers in their own language. The system will support only French and English.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use to meet each requirement? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct requirements. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bat between panes or scroll to view content.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_16.png "Body image")



1. Speech to Text
2. Text to Speech


- Speech to Text with AutoDetectSourceLanguageConfig. It can't be Text Analytics because the input is callers' voice.
- Text to Speech: the output is voice.


### Question #24

You have receipts that are accessible from a URL.

You need to extract data from the receipts by using Form Recognizer and the SDK. The solution must use a prebuilt model. Which client and method should you use?

- A. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- B. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- **C. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method**

- D. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method


**Should be C**

```
private static async Task AnalyzeReceipt(
	FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient, string receiptUri)
	RecognizedFormCollection receipts = await recognizerClient.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUrl)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
)
```

Option A: The StartRecognizeContentFromUri method is used to extract layout information such as tables, lines, words, and selection marks. It’ not specifically designed for receipts.

Option B: The FormTrainingClient is used to train custom models, not to extract data from documents using prebuilt models. Also, the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method, as mentioned above, is not specifically designed for receipts.

Option D: Similar to option B, the FormTrainingClient is not suitable for this scenario as it’s used for training custom models. The StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method would be correct if used with FormRecognizerClient.


### Question #25

You have a collection of 50,000 scanned documents that contain text.

You plan to make the text available through Azure Cognitive Search.

You need to con¬gure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and text analytics. The solution must minimize costs.

What should you attach to the skillset?

- A. a new Computer Vision resource

- B. a free (Limited enrichments) Cognitive Services resource

- C. an Azure Machine Learning Designer pipeline

- **D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

**Selected Answer: D**

You need to configure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and "text analytics"... Just because of this second requirement Answer is a Multi Cognitive Service (D), alone vision service (=OCR wont make any text analytics, text extraction is not text analytics !)


Based on the information from the official Azure documentation, the most cost-effective way to configure an enrichment pipeline for OCR and text analytics in Azure Cognitive Search would be to use a billable Cognitive Services resource. This is because built-in skills, such as OCR and text analytics, are based on the Cognitive Services APIs and unless your content input is small, you would need to attach a billable Cognitive Services resource to run larger workloads.


**D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

This option allows you to use the necessary built-in skills for OCR and text analytics and can handle larger workloads, which would be necessary for processing a large number of documents. The S0 pricing tier is a standard tier that provides a balance between cost and capabilities.


D - free tier is limited to 10,000 documents


### Question #26

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add indexes.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- B. No

**Correct Answer: B**


Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.

Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

> "How your search queries perform is directly connected to the size and complexity of your indexes. The smaller and more optimized your indexes, the fast Azure Cognitive Search can respond to queries.

If your index has been optimized but the performance still isn't where it needs to be, you can choose to scale up or scale out your search service.

The solution provided does not directly address the issue of search query requests being throttled. Adding indexes can improve search performance by optimizing the search process, but it may not directly address throttling issues.


### Question #27

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

Solution: You enable customer-managed key (CMK) encryption.

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not affect throttling.

Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.


Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

Reason for choosing this option: Enabling customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not directly impact the throttling of search query requests in Azure Cognitive Search service. CMK encryption is used for data-at-rest encryption and does not affect the performance or capacity of the search service.



### Question #28

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?

- **A. Yes**

- B. No

**"deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1." is correct.**



A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

- ✑ Azure Storage 
- ✑ Azure Cosmos DB 
- ✑ Azure SQL Database 
- ✑ Your own service using a Private Link Service.

### Question #29

You have a Language Understanding resource named lu1.

You build and deploy an Azure bot named bot1 that uses lu1.

You need to ensure that bot1 adheres to the Microsoft responsible AI principle of inclusiveness. How should you extend bot1?


- A. Implement authentication for bot1.

- B. Enable active learning for lu1.

- C. Host lu1 in a container.

- **D. Add Direct Line Speech to bot1.**


Correct Answer: D

Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.

Topic 1

Direct Line Speech is a robust, end-to-end solution for creating a flexible, extensible voice assistant. 

**It is powered by the Bot Framework and its Direct Line Speech channel, that is optimized for voice-in, voice-out interaction with bots.**


Incorrect:

Not B: The Active learning suggestions feature allows you to improve the quality of your knowledge base by suggesting alternative questions, based on user- submissions, to your question and answer pair. You review those suggestions, either adding them to existing questions or rejecting them.


### Question #30

You are building an app that will process incoming email and direct messages to either French or English language support teams. Which Azure Cognitive Services API should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_17.png "Body image")


**Box1:**

**`https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com `**


Box2:

**`/text/analytics/v3.1/languages`**

NOTE:

Pay special attention to the Sample Request provided. Request to the API should be of the form:


**`POST {Endpoint}/text/analytics/v3.0/languages `**


**Where the {Endpoint} as stated under the sub-heading "URI Parameters" was described as quoted here (see "Description" column of the table): "Supported Cognitive Services endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)."**

So the sample given shows the correct format of the *endpoint* as https://{location}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com

### Question #31


You have an Azure Cognitive Search instance that indexes purchase orders by using Form Recognizer.

You need to analyze the extracted information by using Microsoft Power BI. The solution must minimize development effort. What should you add to the indexer?


- A. a projection group

- **B. a table projection**

- C. a file projection

- D. an object projection

**Should be B . Its for Tables the Power BI**

"Use Power BI for data exploration. This tool works best when the data is in Azure Table Storage. Within Power BI, you can manipulate data into new tables that are easier to query and analyze"


You receive a JSON object, so ObjectProjection is the most appropriate way to explore:

Objects: "Used when you need the full JSON representation of your data and enrichments in one JSON document. As with table projections, only valid JSON objects can be projected as objects, and shaping can help you do that."


**B is the correct answer. See below to understand the workflow:**

Purchase Orders (POs) -> Form Recognizer -> OCR -> JSON (extracted info from POs) -> Shaper skill -> JSON -> Table Projection -> JSON -> Power BI


### Question #32


You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add replicas.**

Does this meet the goal?


- **A. Yes**

- B. No

A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.


**"add replicas" is correct.**


### Question #33

You need to create a Text Analytics service named Text12345678, and then enable logging for Text12345678. The solution must ensure that any changes to Text12345678 will be stored in a Log Analytics workspace.
