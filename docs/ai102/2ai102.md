- ✑ Web Search


PUT: 

- puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI.
- If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.
- If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one.

**POST: POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request.**

### Question #6

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website.

**You plan to monitor the sales system to ensure that it provides equitable results regardless of the user's location or background.**

Which two responsible AI principles provide guidance to meet the monitoring requirements? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. transparency
- **B. fairness**  ✅
- **C. inclusiveness**  ✅
- D. reliability and safety
- E. privacy and security


Correct Answer: BC

- AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- AI systems should perform reliably and safely.


**Fairness** is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle is even more important when AI systems are being
developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or
religion bias toward a group or individual.


**Inclusiveness** mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand
and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition
technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other impairments.


### Question #7

You plan to use containerized versions of the Anomaly Detector API on local devices for testing and in on-premises datacenters.

You need to ensure that the containerized deployments meet the following requirements:

- ✑ Prevent billing and API information from being stored in the command-line histories of the devices that run the container.
- ✑ Control access to the container images by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).


Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and
arrange them in the correct order.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_7.png "Body image")

1. Create a custom docker file
2. Pull the container image (in the dockerfile)
3. Build the image
4. Push to ACR


### Question #8

You plan to deploy a containerized version of an Azure Cognitive Services service that will be used for text analysis.

You configure **https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com** as the endpoint URI for the service, and you pull the latest version of the Text Analytics Sentiment Analysis container.

You need to run the container on an Azure virtual machine by using Docker.

How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_8.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_9.png "Body image")

```
Box 1: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment

To run the Sentiment Analysis v3 container, execute the following docker run command. 

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus \ 
	mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
	Eula=accept \
	Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
	ApiKey={API_KEY} 

is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API. https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com


Box 2: https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com

{ENDPOINT_URI} is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API: https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.a The endpoint for
accessing the Text
```


### Question #9

You have the following C# method for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_10.png "Body image")

You need to call the method to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

Which code should you use?

```
A. create_resource(client, "res", "ComputerVision", "FO", "westus")
B. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision Prediction", "FO", "westus")
C. create_resource(client, "res1", "ComputerVision", "SO", "westus")
D. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "SO", "westus")
```


**A, as there is free tier available for Computer Vision service.**

- Free - Web/Container
- 20 per minute
- 5,000 free transactions per month

The ComputerVision resource is more commonly used because it comes with pre-built capabilities for image analysis, including caption generation, without the need to train a custom model. 

On the other hand, the CustomVision.Prediction you must be specifically trained to support generating captions


### Question #10

You successfully run the following HTTP request.

```
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/18c51a87-3a69-47a8-aedc-a54745f708a1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/contoso1/regenerateKey?api-version=2017-04-18
Body{"keyName": "Key2"}
```


What is the result of the request?


- A. A key for Azure Cognitive Services was generated in Azure Key Vault.
- B. A new query key was generated.
- C. The primary subscription key and the secondary subscription key were rotated.
- **D. The secondary subscription key was reset**.   ✅

This response is indicated by the "keyName": "Key2" in the request body, specifying that the secondary subscription key (Key2) should be regenerated.

> B is wrong. Query key is for search service. The Rest request of create query key is like POST

The request is to the Azure Management API to regenerate a key for an Azure Cognitive Services account (contoso1). The body of the request
specifies {"keyName": "Key2"}, which indicates that the operation is targeted at the secondary subscription key (commonly referred to as Key2 in Azure Cognitive Services management). The regenerateKey action causes the specified key to be reset, generating a new key value for it while invalidating the old one.

### Question #11

You build a custom Form Recognizer model.

You receive sample ¬les to use for training the model as shown in the following table

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_11.png "Body image")

Which three ¬les can you use to train the model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. File1**

- B. File2

- **C. File3**

- D. File4

- E. File5

- **F. File6**


**ACF**


Form Recognizer works on input documents that meet these requirements:

Format must be JPG, PNG, PDF (text or scanned), or TIFF. Text-embedded PDFs are best because there's no possibility of error in character extraction and location.

**File size must be less than 50 MB.**


**File 2 and 5 are excluded.**

New service limits now goes up to 500MB so...

File 1, 3, and 6 are correct for "training the model", however if MSFT remove the word "training" from the question - be careful.

For custom model training the total size is still 50MB. Answer is correct

A. File1 (PDF)

C. File3 (JPG)

F. File6 (JPG)


### Question #12

A customer uses Azure Cognitive Search.

The customer plans to enable a server-side encryption and use customer-managed keys (CMK) stored in Azure. What are three implications of the planned change? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


- **A. The index size will increase.**

- **B. Query times will increase**.

- C. A self-signed X.509 certi¬cate is required.

- D. The index size will decrease.

- E. Query times will decrease.

- **F. Azure Key Vault is required**.


**Should be ABF (use AKV for customer managed key)**


"Customer-managed keys require an additional billable service, Azure Key Vault, which can be in a different region, but under the same subscription, as Azure Cognitive Search. Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance."

 
A. The index size will increase. Enabling CMK encryption increases the index size1.

B. Query times will increase. Enabling CMK encryption degrades query performance. You can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times1.

F. Azure Key Vault is required. CMK encryption depends on Azure Key Vault. You can create your own encryption keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use Azure Key Vault APIs to generate encryption keys1


### Question #13

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website. You plan to notify users that their data has been processed by the sales system.

Which responsible AI principle does this help meet?

- **A. transparency**

- B. fairness

- C. inclusiveness

- D. reliability and safety

The correct answer is A, transparency: "When an AI application relies on personal data, such as a facial recognition system that takes images of people to recognize them; you should make it clear to the user how their data is used and retained, and who has access to it."


- "Transparency: AI systems should be understandable."


- "Reliability and safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely."

### Question #14


Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint to a new virtual network, and you con¬gure Azure Private Link.

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

The Azure Private Link should use a private endpoint, not a public endpoint.

Private Link service can be accessed from approved private endpoints in any public region.


Answer is no. you should create a private link with private endpoint


### Question #15

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

Solution: **You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you configure an IP firewall rule.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**
  
**Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.**

The answer is B because the traffic should not be routed over internet. 

"By default, Azure AI Search is configured to allow connections over a public endpoint. Access to a search service through the public endpoint is protected by authentication and authorization protocols, but the endpoint itself is open to the internet at the network layer for data plane requests."


### Question #16

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you con¬gure a network security group (NSG) for vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?


- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you con¬gure Azure Private Link.

###  Question #17

You plan to perform predictive maintenance.


You collect IoT sensor data from 100 industrial machines for a year. Each machine has 50 different sensors that generate data at one-minute intervals. In total, you have 5,000 time series datasets.

You need to identify unusual values in each time series to help predict machinery failures.

Which Azure service should you use?

- **A. Anomaly Detector**

- B. Cognitive Search

- C. Form Recognizer

- D. Custom Vision

A is the answer.

Anomaly Detector is an AI service with a set of APIs, which enables you to monitor and detect anomalies in your time series data with little machine learning (ML) knowledge, either batch validation or real-time inference.

**D. Azure AI Anomaly Detector**

### Question #18

You are developing a streaming Speech to Text solution that will use the Speech SDK and MP3 encoding. You need to develop a method to convert speech to text for streaming MP3 data.

### Question #19


You are developing an internet-based training solution for remote learners.

Your company identi¬es that during the training, some learners leave their desk for long periods or become distracted.


You need to use a video and audio feed from each learner's computer to detect whether the learner is present and paying attention. The solution must minimize development effort and identify each learner.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use for each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_14.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_15.png "Body image")


1. Face
2. Face
3. Speech

- From Video feed - Face 
- Facial Expression from - Face 
- Audio Feed is - Speech


### Question #20

You plan to provision a QnA Maker service in a new resource group named RG1.

In RG1, you create an App Service plan named AP1.

Which two Azure resources are automatically created in RG1 when you provision the QnA Maker service? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. Language Understanding

- B. Azure SQL Database

- C. Azure Storage

- **D. Azure Cognitive Search**

- **E. Azure App Service**

"When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the data in your own Azure subscription. Azure Search is used to index your data." & "When you create a QnAMaker resource, you host the runtime in your own Azure subscription. App Service is the compute engine that runs the QnA Maker queries for you."


### Question #21

You are building a language model by using a Language Understanding (classic) service. 

You create a new Language Understanding (classic) resource.

You need to add more contributors

What should you use?

- A. a conditional access policy in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

- **B. the Access control (IAM) page for the authoring resources in the Azure portal**

- C. the Access control (IAM) page for the prediction resources in the Azure portal

B is the answer.

In the Azure portal, find your Language Understanding (LUIS) authoring resource. It has the type LUIS.Authoring. In the resource's Access Control (IAM) page, add the role of contributor for the user that you want to contribute.

### Question #22

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

**Using a higher tier does not imply scaling replicas or partitions.**


### Question #23

You need to develop an automated call handling system that can respond to callers in their own language. The system will support only French and English.

Which Azure Cognitive Services service should you use to meet each requirement? To answer, drag the appropriate services to the correct requirements. Each service may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bat between panes or scroll to view content.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_16.png "Body image")



1. Speech to Text
2. Text to Speech


- Speech to Text with AutoDetectSourceLanguageConfig. It can't be Text Analytics because the input is callers' voice.
- Text to Speech: the output is voice.


### Question #24

You have receipts that are accessible from a URL.

You need to extract data from the receipts by using Form Recognizer and the SDK. The solution must use a prebuilt model. Which client and method should you use?

- A. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- B. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method

- **C. the FormRecognizerClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method**

- D. the FormTrainingClient client and the StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method


**Should be C**

```
private static async Task AnalyzeReceipt(
	FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient, string receiptUri)
	RecognizedFormCollection receipts = await recognizerClient.StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri(new Uri(receiptUrl)).WaitForCompletionAsync();
)
```

Option A: The StartRecognizeContentFromUri method is used to extract layout information such as tables, lines, words, and selection marks. It’ not specifically designed for receipts.

Option B: The FormTrainingClient is used to train custom models, not to extract data from documents using prebuilt models. Also, the StartRecognizeContentFromUri method, as mentioned above, is not specifically designed for receipts.

Option D: Similar to option B, the FormTrainingClient is not suitable for this scenario as it’s used for training custom models. The StartRecognizeReceiptsFromUri method would be correct if used with FormRecognizerClient.


### Question #25

You have a collection of 50,000 scanned documents that contain text.

You plan to make the text available through Azure Cognitive Search.

You need to con¬gure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and text analytics. The solution must minimize costs.

What should you attach to the skillset?

- A. a new Computer Vision resource

- B. a free (Limited enrichments) Cognitive Services resource

- C. an Azure Machine Learning Designer pipeline

- **D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

**Selected Answer: D**

You need to configure an enrichment pipeline to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and "text analytics"... Just because of this second requirement Answer is a Multi Cognitive Service (D), alone vision service (=OCR wont make any text analytics, text extraction is not text analytics !)


Based on the information from the official Azure documentation, the most cost-effective way to configure an enrichment pipeline for OCR and text analytics in Azure Cognitive Search would be to use a billable Cognitive Services resource. This is because built-in skills, such as OCR and text analytics, are based on the Cognitive Services APIs and unless your content input is small, you would need to attach a billable Cognitive Services resource to run larger workloads.


**D. a new Cognitive Services resource that uses the S0 pricing tier**

This option allows you to use the necessary built-in skills for OCR and text analytics and can handle larger workloads, which would be necessary for processing a large number of documents. The S0 pricing tier is a standard tier that provides a balance between cost and capabilities.


D - free tier is limited to 10,000 documents


### Question #26

You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add indexes.**

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- B. No

**Correct Answer: B**


Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.

Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

> "How your search queries perform is directly connected to the size and complexity of your indexes. The smaller and more optimized your indexes, the fast Azure Cognitive Search can respond to queries.

If your index has been optimized but the performance still isn't where it needs to be, you can choose to scale up or scale out your search service.

The solution provided does not directly address the issue of search query requests being throttled. Adding indexes can improve search performance by optimizing the search process, but it may not directly address throttling issues.


### Question #27

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

Solution: You enable customer-managed key (CMK) encryption.

Does this meet the goal?

- A. Yes

- **B. No**

Customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not affect throttling.

Instead, you could migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier.


Note: A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing- based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.

Reason for choosing this option: Enabling customer-managed key (CMK) encryption does not directly impact the throttling of search query requests in Azure Cognitive Search service. CMK encryption is used for data-at-rest encryption and does not affect the performance or capacity of the search service.



### Question #28

You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1.

You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing tra®c over the public internet.

**Solution: You deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1.**

Does this meet the goal?

- **A. Yes**

- B. No

**"deploy service1 and a private endpoint to vnet1." is correct.**



A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

- ✑ Azure Storage 
- ✑ Azure Cosmos DB 
- ✑ Azure SQL Database 
- ✑ Your own service using a Private Link Service.

### Question #29

You have a Language Understanding resource named lu1.

You build and deploy an Azure bot named bot1 that uses lu1.

You need to ensure that bot1 adheres to the Microsoft responsible AI principle of inclusiveness. How should you extend bot1?


- A. Implement authentication for bot1.

- B. Enable active learning for lu1.

- C. Host lu1 in a container.

- **D. Add Direct Line Speech to bot1.**


Correct Answer: D

Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.

Topic 1

Direct Line Speech is a robust, end-to-end solution for creating a flexible, extensible voice assistant. 

**It is powered by the Bot Framework and its Direct Line Speech channel, that is optimized for voice-in, voice-out interaction with bots.**


Incorrect:

Not B: The Active learning suggestions feature allows you to improve the quality of your knowledge base by suggesting alternative questions, based on user- submissions, to your question and answer pair. You review those suggestions, either adding them to existing questions or rejecting them.


### Question #30

You are building an app that will process incoming email and direct messages to either French or English language support teams. Which Azure Cognitive Services API should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_17.png "Body image")


**Box1:**

**`https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com `**


Box2:

**`/text/analytics/v3.1/languages`**

NOTE:

Pay special attention to the Sample Request provided. Request to the API should be of the form:


**`POST {Endpoint}/text/analytics/v3.0/languages `**


**Where the {Endpoint} as stated under the sub-heading "URI Parameters" was described as quoted here (see "Description" column of the table): "Supported Cognitive Services endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)."**

So the sample given shows the correct format of the *endpoint* as https://{location}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com

### Question #31


You have an Azure Cognitive Search instance that indexes purchase orders by using Form Recognizer.

You need to analyze the extracted information by using Microsoft Power BI. The solution must minimize development effort. What should you add to the indexer?


- A. a projection group

- **B. a table projection**

- C. a file projection

- D. an object projection

**Should be B . Its for Tables the Power BI**

"Use Power BI for data exploration. This tool works best when the data is in Azure Table Storage. Within Power BI, you can manipulate data into new tables that are easier to query and analyze"


You receive a JSON object, so ObjectProjection is the most appropriate way to explore:

Objects: "Used when you need the full JSON representation of your data and enrichments in one JSON document. As with table projections, only valid JSON objects can be projected as objects, and shaping can help you do that."


**B is the correct answer. See below to understand the workflow:**

Purchase Orders (POs) -> Form Recognizer -> OCR -> JSON (extracted info from POs) -> Shaper skill -> JSON -> Table Projection -> JSON -> Power BI


### Question #32


You have an Azure Cognitive Search service.

During the past 12 months, query volume steadily increased.

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled.

You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled.

**Solution: You add replicas.**

Does this meet the goal?


- **A. Yes**

- B. No

A simple fix to most throttling issues is to throw more resources at the search service (typically replicas for query-based throttling, or partitions for indexing-based throttling). However, increasing replicas or partitions adds cost, which is why it is important to know the reason why throttling is occurring at all.


**"add replicas" is correct.**

To authenticate with a Microsoft Entra token, the Speech resource must have a custom subdomain and use a private endpoint. The Speech service uses custom subdomains with private endpoints only.


- B. Configure a custom subdomain: This is necessary because Azure AD authentication requires a custom domain for the Speech service.

- D. Create a private endpoint: This ensures secure communication between the app and the Speech service.

These actions align with the best practices for securing Azure services and enable the app to use Azure AD tokens for authentication.

B. Configure a custom subdomain: This is necessary when using Azure AD authentication with a private endpoint. However, it's also a requirement for using Azure AD authentication in general with the Speech service.

C. Request an X.509 certificate: This is not needed for Azure AD token-based authentication. It's typically used for client certificate authentication


### Question #58

You plan to deploy an Azure OpenAI resource by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

You need to ensure that the resource can respond to 600 requests per minute.

How should you complete the template? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_34.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_35.png "Body image")

Azure OpenAI allows you to manage how frequently your application can make inferencing requests. Your rate limits are based on Tokens-perMinute (TPM). For example, if you have a capacity of 1, this equals 1,000 TPM, and the rate limit of requests you can make per minute (RPM) is calculated using a ratio. For every 1,000 TPM, you can make 6 RPM.

When a deployment is created, the assigned TPM will directly map to the tokens-per-minute rate limit enforced on its inferencing requests. A Requests-Per-Minute (RPM) rate limit will also be enforced whose value is set proportionally to the TPM assignment using the following ratio:

**6 RPM per 1000 TPM.**

**So the math is 600 RPM needs 100000 TPM which translates to capacity 100**

### Question #59

You have an app that manages feedback.

You need to ensure that the app can detect negative comments by using the Sentiment Analysis API in Azure AI Language. The solution must ensure that the managed feedback remains on your company’s internal network.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_36.png "Body image")

1. **Provision the Language service resource in Azure**. This step involves creating the Azure Language service resource, which will provide you with the necessary credentials and endpoint URL to use the Sentiment Analysis API.

2. **Deploy a Docker container to an on-premises server**. By deploying a Docker container on-premises, you can run the Sentiment Analysis API locally, ensuring that the feedback data does not leave your internal network.

3. **Run the container and query the prediction endpoint**. Once the container is running on your on-premises server, you can start sending feedback data to the Sentiment Analysis API by querying the prediction endpoint provided by the Language service.

### Question #65


You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure AI Service resource named CSAccount1 and a virtual network named VNet1. CSAaccount1 is connected to VNet1.

You need to ensure that only speci¬c resources can access CSAccount1. The solution must meet the following requirements:

- Prevent external access to CSAccount1.
- Minimize administrative effort.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

- **A. In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1**.

- B. In CSAccount1, con¬gure the Access control (IAM) settings.

- C. In VNet1, modify the virtual network settings.

- D. In VNet1, create a virtual subnet.

- **E. In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings.**

A. **In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1**. This allows you to secure your Azure service resources to the virtual network.

E. **In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings**. This will allow you to configure CSAccount1 to accept connections only from the virtual network VNet1.

Enabling service endpoints and modifying the virtual network settings for the AI Service resource will limit access to the resources within VNet1, effectively fulfilling both requirements.


- A - creating a service endpoint for csaccount1 on vnet1 ensures that its the only way of accessing the service and it ensures a secure connection 
- E - adding network settings on service csaccount1 will ensure that the access is restricted to resources within vnet1

To ensure that only specific resources can access CSAccount1 and prevent external access while minimizing administrative effort, you should perform the following actions:

A. In VNet1, enable a service endpoint for CSAccount1.

E. In CSAccount1, modify the virtual network settings.

Explanation:

Enable a Service Endpoint for CSAccount1 (Action A):

Service endpoints provide direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network. By enabling a service endpoint for CSAccount1 on VNet1, you ensure that the traffic between VNet1 and CSAccount1 does not go over the internet, enhancing security and meeting the requirement to prevent external access.

Modify the Virtual Network Settings in CSAccount1 (Action E):

Configuring the virtual network settings in CSAccount1 allows you to specify which subnets within VNet1 can access the AI service. This way, can control access at a more granular level and ensure that only specific resources within those subnets can access CSAccount1.

### Question #10


You have an Azure Video Analyzer for Media (previously Video Indexer) service that is used to provide a search interface over company videos on your company's website.

You need to be able to search for videos based on who is present in the video.

What should you do?


- **A. Create a person model and associate the model to the videos**.

- B. Create person objects and provide face images for each object.

- C. Invite the entire staff of the company to Video Indexer.

- D. Edit the faces in the videos.

- E. Upload names to a language model.

**Correct Answer: A**

Video Indexer supports multiple Person models per account. Once a model is created, you can use it by providing the model ID of a speci¬c Person model when uploading/indexing or reindexing a video. Training a new face for a video updates the speci¬c custom model that the video was associated with.

Note: Video Indexer supports face detection and celebrity recognition for video content. The celebrity recognition feature covers about one million faces based on commonly requested data source such as IMDB, Wikipedia, and top LinkedIn influencers. Faces that aren't recognized by the celebrity recognition feature are detected but left unnamed. Once you label a face with a name, the face and name get added to your account's Person model. Video Indexer will then recognize this face in your future videos and past videos.\

Note: Given query face's faceId, to search the similar-looking faces from a faceId array, a face list or a large face list. A "faceListId" is created by FaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will not expire. And a "largeFaceListId" is created by LargeFaceList - Create containing persistedFaceIds that will also not expire.

Incorrect Answers:

Not "faceListId": Add a face to a speci¬ed face list, up to 1,000 faces.


**Box 2: matchFace**


Find similar has two working modes, "matchPerson" and "matchFace". "matchPerson" is the default mode that it tries to ¬nd faces of the same person as possible by using internal same-person thresholds. It is useful to ¬nd a known person's other photos. Note that an empty list will be returned if no faces pass the internal thresholds. "matchFace" mode ignores same-person thresholds and returns ranked similar faces anyway, even the similarity is low. It can be used in the cases like searching celebrity-looking faces.


1. LargeFaceListId
2. matchFace

### Question #13

You are developing a photo application that will fiond photos of a person based on a sample image by using the Face API.

	await faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(personGroupId, personId, stream); 
  }
```


### Question #16

Your company uses an Azure Cognitive Services solution to detect faces in uploaded images. The method to detect the faces uses the following code.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_60.png "Body image")

You discover that the solution frequently fails to detect faces in blurred images and in images that contain sideways faces.

You need to increase the likelihood that the solution can detect faces in blurred images and images that contain sideways faces. What should you do?

- A. Use a different version of the Face API.

- B. Use the Computer Vision service instead of the Face service.

- C. Use the Identify method instead of the Detect method.

- **D. Change the detection model**.

**D**

**Evaluate different models.**

The best way to compare the performances of the detection models is to use them on a sample dataset. We recommend calling the Face Detect API on a variety of images, especially images of many faces or of faces that are di®cult to see, using each detection model. Pay attention to the number of faces that each model returns.

The different face detection models are optimized for different tasks. See the following table for an overview of the differences.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_61.png "Body image")

**use `detection_02` or `detection_03`.**

### Question #17 

You have the following Python function for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically. 

```
def create_resource (resource_name, kind, account_tier, location) : 

	parameters = CognitiveServicesAccount(sku=Sku(name=account_tier), kind=kind, location=location, properties={}) 
    	result = client.accounts.create(resource_group_name, resource_name, parameters) 
```
You need to call the function to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

Which code should you use?


```
A. create_resource("res1", "ComputerVision", "F0", "westus")

B. create_resource("res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "F0", "westus")

C. create_resource("res1", "ComputerVision", "S0", "westus")

D. create_resource("res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "S0", "westus")
```

**`A. create_resource("res1", "ComputerVision", "F0", "westus")`**


**Computer vision provide automatic vision solutions including captions. The key-phrase is "automatic".**


### Question #18

You are developing a method that uses the Computer Vision client library. The method will perform optical character recognition (OCR) in images. The method has the following code.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_62.png "Body image")

During testing, you discover that the call to the GetReadResultAsync method occurs before the read operation is complete. 

You need to prevent the GetReadResultAsync method from proceeding until the read operation is complete.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point


```
A. Remove the operation_id parameter.

B. Add code to verify the read_results.status value.

C. Add code to verify the status of the read_operation_location value.

D. Wrap the call to get_read_result within a loop that contains a delay.
```

- **B. Add code to verify the `read_results.status` value.**

- **D. Wrap the call to `get_read_result` within a loop that contains a delay.**


In order to prevent the GetReadResultAsync method from proceeding until the read operation is complete, we need to check the status of the read operation and wait until it's completed. 


To do this, we can add code to verify the status of the `read_results.status` value. If the status is not "succeeded", we can add a delay and then retry the operation until it's complete. 

**This can be achieved by wrapping the call to `get_read_result` within a loop that contains a delay.**

Removing the `operation_id` parameter or adding code to verify the status of the `read_operation_location` value will not solve the issue of waiting for the read operation to complete before proceeding with the GetReadResultAsync method.


### Question #19

You are building an app that will enable users to upload images. The solution must meet the following requirements: * Automatically suggest alt text for the images.

* Detect inappropriate images and block them.

**One option to manage your Computer Vision containers on-premises is to use Kubernetes and Helm.**

Three primary parameters for all Cognitive Services containers are required. The Microsoft Software License Terms must be present with a value of accept. An Endpoint URI and API key are also needed.


### Question #21

You have an Azure Cognitive Search solution and a collection of handwritten letters stored as JPEG files.

You plan to index the collection. The solution must ensure that queries can be performed on the contents of the letters.

You need to create an indexer that has a skillset.

Which skill should you include?

- A. image analysis

- **B. optical character recognition (OCR)**

- C. key phrase extraction

- D. document extraction

To ensure that queries can be performed on the contents of the letters, the skill that should be included in the indexer is optical character recognition (OCR).


Option B, optical character recognition (OCR), is a technology that can recognize text within an image and convert it into machine-readable text. This skill will enable the search engine to read the handwritten letters and convert them into searchable text that can be indexed by Azure Cognitive Search.

Option A, image analysis, is a useful skill for analyzing images to extract metadata, but it does not directly enable text recognition.

Option C, key phrase extraction, extracts important phrases and concepts from text, but it requires the text to be already recognized and extracted by OCR or other text extraction techniques.

Option D, document extraction, is a skill that extracts specific pieces of information from documents, but it does not address the challenge of recognizing and extracting text from handwritten letters.

### Question #22

You have a library that contains thousands of images.

You need to tag the images as photographs, drawings, or clipart.

Which service endpoint and response property should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_64.png "Body image")

- 1 - Computer Vision analyze image 

- 2 - imageType

With the Analyze Image API, Computer Vision can analyze the content type of images, indicating whether an image is clip art or a line drawing.

- Service endpoint: Computer Vision image classification 
- Property: imageType

  
The Computer Vision image classification endpoint allows you to classify images into different categories, and the imageType property specifically provides information about the type of image, such as whether it is a photograph, drawing, or clipart.


### Question #23

You have an app that captures live video of exam candidates.

You need to use the Face service to validate that the subjects of the videos are real people.

What should you do?

- A. Call the face detection API and retrieve the face rectangle by using the FaceRectangle attribute.

- **B. Call the face detection API repeatedly and check for changes to the FaceAttributes.HeadPose attribute.**

- C. Call the face detection API and use the FaceLandmarks attribute to calculate the distance between pupils.

- D. Call the face detection API repeatedly and check for changes to the FaceAttributes.Accessories attribute.

**B is the answer.**

You can detect head gestures like nodding and head shaking by tracking HeadPose changes in real time. You can use this feature as a custom liveness detector.

Liveness detection is the task of determining that a subject is a real person and not an image or video representation. A head gesture detector could serve as one way to help verify liveness, especially as opposed to an image representation of a person.

### Question #24

You make an API request and receive the results shown in the following exhibits.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_65.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_66.png "Body image")

Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_67.png "Body image")

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_68.png "Body image")

**1. detects**

**2. 797, 201**

Each detected face corresponds to a faceRectangle field in the response. This is a set of pixel coordinates for the left, top, width, and height of th detected face. Using these coordinates, you can get the location and size of the face. In the API response, faces are listed in size order from larges to smallest.


- QualityForRecognition

The overall image quality regarding whether the image being used in the detection is of sufficient quality to attempt face recognition on. The value is an informal rating of low, medium, or high. Only "high" quality images are recommended for person enrollment, and quality at or above "medium" is recommended for identification scenarios.


```
To answer the first question see the endpoint .../face/v1.0/detect?....


To answer the second question see the first object from the response "faceRectangle": {"TOP":201, "LEFT:"797....}
```

### Question #25

You have an Azure subscription that contains an AI enrichment pipeline in Azure Cognitive Search and an Azure Storage account that has 10 GB of scanned documents and images.

You need to index the documents and images in the storage account. The solution must minimize how long it takes to build the index.

What should you do?

- **A. From the Azure portal, configure parallel indexing.**

- B. From the Azure portal, configure scheduled indexing.

- C. Configure field mappings by using the REST API.

- D. Create a text-based indexer by using the REST API.

If you partition your data, you can create multiple indexer-data-source combinations that pull from each data source and write to the same search index. Because each indexer is distinct, you can run them at the same time, populating a search index more quickly than if you ran them sequentially.

### Question #26

You need to analyze video content to identify any mentions of specific company names.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_69.png "Body image")


1. Sign in to Azure Video Analyzer for Media website

2. From Content model customization, select Brands

3. Add specific company names to include list

### Question #27

You have a mobile app that manages printed forms.

You need the app to send images of the forms directly to Forms Recognizer to extract relevant information. For compliance reasons, the image ¬les must not be stored in the cloud.

In which format should you send the images to the Form Recognizer API endpoint?

- **A. raw image binary**

- B. form URL encoded

- C. JSON

**Selected Answer: A**

To send images to the Form Recognizer API endpoint without storing them in the cloud, you should send the images in the following format:

**A. raw image binary**

Sending the images as raw image binary data allows you to transmit the image directly to the Form Recognizer API without the need to store them in the cloud or convert them into other formats. This format ensures compliance with your requirements

### Question #28

You plan to build an app that will generate a list of tags for uploaded images. The app must meet the following requirements:

- Generate tags in a user's preferred language.

- • Support English, French, and Spanish.

- • Minimize development effort.

You need to build a function that will generate the tags for the app.

Which Azure service endpoint should you use?

- A. Content Moderator Image Moderation

- B. Custom Vision image classi¬cation

- **C. Computer Vision Image Analysis**

- D. Custom Translator

**Selected Answer: C**

I think the answer should be C, because of the minimized developement effort. Since the prebuilt model of C also fits the other two requirements, so there is no need to train a custom model.


### Question #29

You develop a test method to verify the results retrieved from a call to the Computer Vision API. The call is used to analyze the existence of company logos in images. The call returns a collection of brands named brands

You have the following code segment.

`-y Y-coordinate of the top left point of the area, in pixels.`

`-h Height measured from the top-left point of the area, in pixels.`

`-w Width measured from the top-left point of the area, in pixels.`


### Question #30

You have a factory that produces cardboard packaging for food products. The factory has intermittent internet connectivity.

The packages are required to include four samples of each product.


You need to build a Custom Vision model that will identify defects in packaging and provide the location of the defects to an operator. The model must ensure that each package contains the four products.

Which project type and domain should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate options to the correct targets. Each option may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_72.png "Body image")


1. Object detection
2. General (compact)

**Select Object Detection under Project Types.**

**The models generated by compact domains can be exported to run locally.**


### Question #31

You are building a model to detect objects in images.

The performance of the model based on training data is shown in the following exhibit.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_73.png "Body image")


Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_74.png "Body image")

1. 0
2. 25

- Precision: Measures how precise/accurate your model is. It's the ratio between the correctly identified positives (true positives) and all identified positives. The precision metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correctly labeled.

**`Precision = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Positive)`**

- Recall: Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It's the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct. Recall = #True_Positive / (#True_Positive + #False_Negatives)

### Question #32


You are building an app that will include one million scanned magazine articles. Each article will be stored as an image ¬le.

You need to con¬gure the app to extract text from the images. The solution must minimize development effort.

What should you include in the solution?


- A. Computer Vision Image Analysis

- **B. the Read API in Computer Vision**

- C. Form Recognizer

- D. Azure Cognitive Service for Language

**Selected Answer: B**


With the new Image Analysis API 4.0 (in preview) you could use OCR feature too, but as i said, it is in preview. don't think it is considered in the exam.

Instead the Read API is particularly adapted for text-heavy documents and it seems this is the case


A - Computer Vision Image Analysis: This is a service provided by Azure that can extract a wide variety of visual features from your images. It determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces. However, while it does have OCR capabilities, it is not specifically designed for large-scale text extraction from images.

B - Read API in Computer Vision: This is a part of the Azure Computer Vision service that is designed to extract printed and handwritten text images. It uses state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms optimized for text-heavy documents2. This could be a good your needs as it is designed to handle large amounts of text in images.

the key here is option A it is not specifically designed for large-scale text extraction from images.

### Question #33

You have a 20-GB video file named File1.avi that is stored on a local drive.

You need to index File1.avi by using the Azure Video Indexer website.

What should you do first?

- A. Upload File1.avi to an Azure Storage queue.

- B. Upload File1.avi to the Azure Video Indexer website.

- **C. Upload File1.avi to Microsoft OneDrive.**

- D. Upload File1.avi to the www.youtube.com webpage.

Max file size for direct upload is 2 GB . 30 GB is through url.so answer C

**B. Upload File1.avi to the Azure Video Indexer website.**

Upload file size and video duration If uploading a file from your device, the file size limit is 2 GB.

**If the video is uploaded from a URL, the file size limit is 30 GB.** 

The URL must lead to an online media file with a media file extension (for exampl myvideo.MP4) and not a webpage such as https://www.youtube.com.
