- If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.
- If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one.

**POST: POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request.**

### Question #6

You are developing a new sales system that will process the video and text from a public-facing website.

**You plan to monitor the sales system to ensure that it provides equitable results regardless of the user's location or background.**

Which two responsible AI principles provide guidance to meet the monitoring requirements? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.


- A. transparency
- **B. fairness**  ✅
- **C. inclusiveness**  ✅
- D. reliability and safety
- E. privacy and security


Correct Answer: BC

- AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- AI systems should perform reliably and safely.


**Fairness** is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle is even more important when AI systems are being
developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or
religion bias toward a group or individual.


**Inclusiveness** mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and inclusive design practices can help developers to understand
and address potential barriers that could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition
technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other impairments.


### Question #7

You plan to use containerized versions of the Anomaly Detector API on local devices for testing and in on-premises datacenters.

You need to ensure that the containerized deployments meet the following requirements:

- ✑ Prevent billing and API information from being stored in the command-line histories of the devices that run the container.
- ✑ Control access to the container images by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

### Question #8

You plan to deploy a containerized version of an Azure Cognitive Services service that will be used for text analysis.

You configure **https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com** as the endpoint URI for the service, and you pull the latest version of the Text Analytics Sentiment Analysis container.

You need to run the container on an Azure virtual machine by using Docker.

How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_8.png "Body image”)

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_9.png "Body image”)

```
Box 1: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment

To run the Sentiment Analysis v3 container, execute the following docker run command. 

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 8g --cpus \ 
	mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/textanalytics/sentiment \
	Eula=accept \
	Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
	ApiKey={API_KEY} 

is the endpoint for accessing the Text Analytics API. https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com

```


### Question #9

You have the following C# method for creating Azure Cognitive Services resources programmatically.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_2_10.png "Body image”)

You need to call the method to create a free Azure resource in the West US Azure region. The resource will be used to generate captions of images automatically.

Which code should you use?

```
A. create_resource(client, "res", "ComputerVision", "FO", "westus")
B. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision Prediction", "FO", "westus")
C. create_resource(client, "res1", "ComputerVision", "SO", "westus")
D. create_resource(client, "res1", "CustomVision.Prediction", "SO", "westus")
```


**A, as there is free tier available for Computer Vision service.**

- Free - Web/Container
- 20 per minute
- 5,000 free transactions per month

The ComputerVision resource is more commonly used because it comes with pre-built capabilities for image analysis, including caption generation, without the need to train a custom model. 

On the other hand, the CustomVision.Prediction you must be specifically trained to support generating captions


### Question #10

You successfully run the following HTTP request.

```
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/18c51a87-3a69-47a8-aedc-a54745f708a1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/contoso1/regenerateKey?api-version=2017-04-18
Body{"keyName": "Key2"}
```


What is the result of the request?


- A. A key for Azure Cognitive Services was generated in Azure Key Vault.
- B. A new query key was generated.
- C. The primary subscription key and the secondary subscription key were rotated.
- **D. The secondary subscription key was reset**.   ✅

This response is indicated by the "keyName": "Key2" in the request body, specifying that the secondary subscription key (Key2) should be regenerated.

> B is wrong. Query key is for search service. The Rest request of create query key is like POST

The request is to the Azure Management API to regenerate a key for an Azure Cognitive Services account (contoso1). The body of the request
specifies {"keyName": "Key2"}, which indicates that the operation is targeted at the secondary subscription key (commonly referred to as Key2 in Azure Cognitive Services management). The regenerateKey action causes the specified key to be reset, generating a new key value for it while invalidating the old one.
