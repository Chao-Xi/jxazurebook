## 1 AI VS GenAI

### 1-1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI is computer systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

These include:

* problem-solving
* decision-making
* understanding natural language
* recognizing speech and images


> AI's goal is to **interpret, analyze, and respond to human actions**.
> 
> To simulate human intelligence in machines.

* Simulate: mimic aspects, resembles behaviour
* Emulate: replicates exact processes and mechanisms.

AI applications are vast and include areas like:

* expert systems
* natural language processing
* speech recognition
* robotics

**AI is used in various industries for tasks such as:**

* **B2C** : customer service chatbots
* **commerce**: recommendation systems
* **Auto**: autonomous vehicles
* **Medical**: medical diagnosis.

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of AI that focuses on **creating new content or data** that is novel and realistic. It can interpret or analyze data but also **generates new data itself**.

**It includes generating text, images, music, speech, and other forms of media.**

It often involves advanced machine learning techniques:

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
* Transformer models g GPT

**Generative AI has multiple modalities:**

* **Vision**: realistic images and videos
* **Text**: generating human-like text
* **Audio**: composing music
* **Molecular**: Drug discovery via genomic data

> Large Language Models (LLMs) which generate out human-like text is a subset of GenAl but is often
conflating with being Al due to it being the most popular and developed.

### What is a Foundational Model?

A Foundational Model (FM) is a general purpose model that is trained on vast amounts of data.


We say that an FM is pretrained because it can be fined tuned for specific tasks.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_2.png "Body image")


> Ms are a specialized subset of FMs that uses transformer architecture.

## 2 What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a Foundational Model **that implements the transformer architecture.**

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_3.png "Body image")

During this training phase, the model learns semantics (patterns) of language, such as grammar, word usage, sentence structure, style and tone.


> It is simple to say that LLM just predicts the next sequences of words, but researchers don't know how LLMs generate their outputs.

### Transformer Architecture

**Transformer Architecture** was developed by researchers at Google that is effective at
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** due to **multi-head attention** and **positional encoding**.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_4.png "Body image")

**1. Encoder: reads and understands the input text**. 

It's like a smart system that goes through everything it's been taught (which is a lot of text) and picks up on the meanings of words and how they're used in different contexts.

### **Tokens and Capacity**

**When using transformers the decoder continuously feeds the sequence of tokens back** in as output to help predict the next word in the input.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_5.png "Body image")

**Memory**

* Each token in a sequence requires memory

* As the token count increases, the memory increases.
 
* The memory usage eventually becomes exhausted.

**Compute**

model perform more operations for each additional token
Longer sequences require more compute

> AI services that offer Models-as-a-Service will often have a limit of combined input and output.

### What are Embeddings?

**What is a Vector?**

An arrow with a length and a direction

**What is a Vector Space Model?**

Represents text documents or other types of data as vectors in a High Dimensional space


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_6.png "Body image")

**What are embeddings?**

They are vectors of data used by ML models to **find relationships between data.**

ML models can also create embeddings.

_**Different embedding algorithms capture different kinds of relationships.**_

> You can think of embeddings as external memory for performing a task for ML models.
> 
> 
> Embeddings can be shared across models (Multi-model pattern) to help coordinate a task between models.

### Positional encoding 

**Positional encoding** is a technique used to preserve **order of words** when processing natural language.

Transformers need positional encoders because **they do not process data sequentially** and would lose order of understanding when analyze large bodies of text.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_7.png "Body image")

> Positional encoding adds a **positional vector** to each word to keep track of the positions of the words.

### Attention 

**Attention** figures out how each word (or token) **in a sequence** is important to other words within that sequence by assigning the words weights.

#### **Self-Attention**

Computes attention weights within the same input sequence, where each element attends to all other elements.

> Used in transformers to model relationships in
sequences (e.g., words in a sentence).

#### Cross-Attention

Computes attention weights between two different sequences. allowing one sequence to attend to another sequence.

> Used in tasks like translation where the output sequence (decoder) needs to focus on the input sequence (encoder).

#### Multi-head Attention

Combines multiple self-attention (or cross-attention) heads in parallel, each focusing on different aspects of the input.

> Used in transformers to improve performance and capture various dependencies simultaneously.

**Multi-headed** because it receiving multiple inputs

**Self-Attention** Self-attention because it feeds back its own sequence

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_8.png "Body image")

**Multi-headed** because it receiving multiple inputs

**Cross-attention** because it feeds sequence inputs from two different sources

## Supervised  vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement

### Supervised Learning (SL)

Data that has been labeled for training Task-driven - **make a prediction**

* When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome.
* When you need a specific value returned

eg. Classification, Regression

### Unsupervised Learning (SL)

Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to
do its own labeling

**Data-driven - recognize a structure or pattern**

* When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise.
* When you're trying to make sense of data.

eg. Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association

### Reinforcement Learning (RI)

There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data any many attempt to reach a goal

**Decisions-driven - Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot
Navigation**

### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

**Activation Functions**

An algorithm applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output e.g. ReLu

**Dense**

When the next layer increases the amount of nodes

**Sparse**

When the next layer decreases the amount of nodes

**What are Neural Networks? (NN)**

* Often described as **mimicking the brain**, a **neuron/node represents an algorithm**.
* Data is inputted into a neuron and based on the output the data will be passed to
* one of many other connected neurals.
* The connection between neurons is weighted.
* The network is organized in layers.
* There will be a input layer, 1 to many hidden layers and an output layer.


**What is Deep Learning?**

A neural network that has **3 or more hidden layers** is considered deep learning.

**What is Feed Forward? (FNN)**

Neural Networks where connections between nodes do not form a cycle (always move forward)

**What is Backpropagation (BP)?**

Moves backwards through the neural network adjusting weights to improve outcome on next iteration. This is how a neural net learns.

**Loss Function**

A function that compares the ground truth to the prediction to determine the error rate (how bad the network performed)

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_9.png "Body image")

## What is a GPU?

A General Processing Unit (GPU) that is specially designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video **concurrently**.

GPUs can perform **<mark>parallel operations on multiple sets of data</mark>**, and so they are commonly used for **non-graphical tasks such as machine learning** and scientific computation.

CPU can have **average 4 to 16 processor cores.**

GPU can thousands of processor cores 4 to 8 GPUs can provide as many as 40.000 cores

GPUs are best suited for repetitive and highly-parallel computing tasks:

* Rendering graphics
* Cryptocurrency mining

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_10.png "Body image")

### What is CUDA?

**What is NVIDA?**

NVIDA is a company that manufactures **graphical processing units (GPUs)** for gaming and professional markets


**What is CUDA?**

Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a **parallel computing platform** and **API**
by NVIDIA that allows developers to use **CUDA-enabled GPUs** for **general-purpose
computing on GPUs (GPGPU)**


All major deep learning frameworks are integrated with **NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK**

The NVIDA Deep Learning SDK is a collection of NVIDIA libraries for deep learning.

One of those libraries is the **CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN)**

cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as:

* forward and backward convolution
* Pooling
* Normalization
* activation layers

### What is Jupyter Notebook?

**Jupyter Notebook**

A Web-based application for authoring documents that combine:

* live-code
* narrative text
* equations
* visualizations

iPython's notebook feature became Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks were overhauled and better **integrated into an IDE called JupyterLab**


You generally want to open Notebooks in Labs

The legacy web-based interface is known as **Jupyter classic notebook**

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_11.png "Body image")

### What is JupyterLab?

**JupyterLab is a a next-generation web-based user interface**

All the familiar features of the classic Jupyter Notebook in a flexible and powerful user interface:

* notebook
* Terminal
* text editor

## Responsible AI

**Responsible AI focuses on ethical, transparent and accountable use of AI** technologies

Microsoft puts into practice Responsible AI via its six Microsoft AI principles


1. **Fairness** - AI systems should treat all people fairly
2. **Reliability and Safety** - AI systems should perform reliably and safely
3. **Privacy and Security** - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
4. **Inclusiveness** - AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
5. **Transparency** - AI systems should be understandable
6. **Accountability** - People should be accountable for AI systems


### Fairness

* AI systems should treat all people fairly
* AI systems can reinforce existing societal stereotypical
* Bias can be introduced during the development of a pipeline

**AI systems that are used to allocate or withhold:**

* opportunities
* resources
* Information

**In domains:**

* Criminal Justice
* Employment and Hiring
* Finance and Credit

eg. an ML model designed to select final applicants for a hiring pipeline without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity or may result in an unfair advantage

***Azure ML can tell you how each feature can influence a model's prediction for bias***

**Fairlearn** is an open-source python project to help data scientist to improve fairness in their Al systems

### Responsible AI - Reliability and safety

***AI systems should perform reliably and safely***

AI software must be rigorous tested to ensure they work as expected before release to the end user

If there are scenarios where Al is making mistakes its important to release a report **quantified risks and harms** to end-users so they are informed of the short-comings of an AI solution

AI where concern for reliability and safety for humans is critically important:

* Autonomous Vehicle
* AI health diagnosis, AI suggesting prescriptions
* Autonomous Weapon Systems

### Responsible AI - Privacy and security

***AI systems should be secure and respect privacy***

AI can require vasts amounts of data to train Deep Learning ML models.

The nature of the ML model may require **personally identifiable information (PII)**

***It is important that we ensure protection of user data that it is not leaked or disclosed***


In some cases ML Models can be run locally on a user's device so their PII remains on their device avoiding that vulnerability

AI Security Principles to detect malicious actors:

* Data Origin and Lineage
* Data Use Internal vs External
* Data Corruption Considerations
* Anomaly detection

### Responsible AI - Inclusiveness

**AI systems should empower everyone and engage people**

If we can design AI solutions for the minority of users 

Then we can design AI solutions for the majority of users

**Minority Groups**

* physical ability
* gender
* sexual orientation
* ethnicity
* other factors

### Responsible AI - Transparency

**AI systems should be understandable**

Interpretability / Intelligibility is when end-users can understand the behaviour of the UI

Transparency of AI systems can result in

* Mitigating unfairness
* Help developers debug their AI systems
* Gaining more trust from our users

Those build AI systems should be:

* open about the why they are using AI
* open about the limitations of their AI systems

Adopting an open-source AI framework can provide transparency (at least from a technical perceptive) on the internal workings of an AI systems

### Responsible AI - Accountability

**People should be accountable for AI systems**

The structure put in place to consistently enacting AI principles and taking them into account

AI systems should work within:

* framework of governance
* organizational principles

ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined

Principles guide Microsoft on how they **Develop, Sell and Advocate** when working
with third-parties and this can push towards regulations towards Al Principles

## Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction

Microsoft has a free web-app that goes through practical scenarios to teach Microsoft Al Principle
