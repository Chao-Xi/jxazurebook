## 1 AI VS GenAI

### 1-1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI is computer systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

These include:

* problem-solving
* decision-making
* understanding natural language
* recognizing speech and images


> AI's goal is to **interpret, analyze, and respond to human actions**.
> 
> To simulate human intelligence in machines.

* **Simulate**: mimic aspects, resembles behaviour
* **Emulate**: replicates exact processes and mechanisms.

AI applications are vast and include areas like:

* expert systems
* natural language processing
* speech recognition
* robotics

**AI is used in various industries for tasks such as:**

* **B2C** : customer service chatbots
* **commerce**: recommendation systems
* **Auto**: autonomous vehicles
* **Medical**: medical diagnosis.

### 1-2 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of AI that focuses on **creating new content or data** that is novel and realistic. 

It can interpret or analyze data but also **generates new data itself**.

**It includes generating text, images, music, speech, and other forms of media.**

It often involves advanced machine learning techniques:

* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
* Transformer models gGPT

**Generative AI has multiple modalities:**

* **Vision**: realistic images and videos
* **Text**: generating human-like text
* **Audio**: composing music
* **Molecular**: Drug discovery via genomic data

> Large Language Models (LLMs) which generate out human-like text is a subset of GenAI but is often conflating with being AI due to it being the most popular and developed.

### 1-3 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Functionality**: AI focuses on understanding and decision-making

**Data Handling** AI analyzes and makes decisions based on existing data

**Applications**: Spans across various sectors, including data analysis, automation, natural language processing, and healthcare

### 1-4 Generative AI

**Functionality** Generative AI is about creating new, original outputs.

**Data Handling** Generative AI uses existing data to generate new, unseen outputs. 

**Applications**: creative and innovative, focusing on content creation, synthetic data generation, deepfakes, and design


### 1-5 What is a Foundational Model?

A Foundational Model (FM) is a general purpose model that is trained on vast amounts of data.


We say that an FM is pretrained because it can be fined tuned for specific tasks.


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_2.png "Body image")


> Ms are a specialized subset of FMs that uses transformer architecture.

## 2 What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a Foundational Model **that implements the transformer architecture.**

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_3.png "Body image")

During this training phase, the model learns semantics (patterns) of language, such as grammar, word usage, sentence structure, style and tone.


> It is simple to say that LLM just predicts the next sequences of words, but researchers don't know how LLMs generate their outputs.

### 2-1 Transformer Architecture

<mark>**Transformer Architecture** was developed by researchers at Google that is effective at **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** due to **multi-head attention** and **positional encoding**.</mark>

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_4.png "Body image")

**1. Encoder: reads and understands the input text**. 

It's like a smart system that goes through everything it's been taught (which is a lot of text) and picks up on the meanings of words and how they're used in different contexts.

### 2-2 **Tokens and Capacity**

**When using transformers the decoder continuously feeds the sequence of tokens back** in as output to help predict the next word in the input.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_5.png "Body image")

**Memory**

* Each token in a sequence requires memory

* As the token count increases, the memory increases.
 
* The memory usage eventually becomes exhausted.

**Compute**

* model perform more operations for each additional token
* Longer sequences require more compute

> AI services that offer Models-as-a-Service will often have a limit of combined input and output.

### 2-3 What are Embeddings?

**What is a Vector?**

An arrow with a length and a direction

**What is a Vector Space Model?**

Represents text documents or other types of data as vectors in a High Dimensional space


![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_6.png "Body image")

**What are embeddings?**

They are vectors of data used by ML models to **find relationships between data.**

ML models can also create embeddings.

_**Different embedding algorithms capture different kinds of relationships.**_

> You can think of embeddings as external memory for performing a task for ML models.
> 
> 
> Embeddings can be shared across models (Multi-model pattern) to help coordinate a task between models.

### 2-4 Positional encoding 

**Positional encoding** is a technique used to preserve **order of words** when processing natural language.

Transformers need positional encoders because **they do not process data sequentially** and would lose order of understanding when analyze large bodies of text.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_7.png "Body image")

> Positional encoding adds a **positional vector** to each word to keep track of the positions of the words.

### 2-5 Attention 

**Attention** figures out how each word (or token) **in a sequence** is important to other words within that sequence **by assigning the words weights**.

#### **Self-Attention**

Computes attention weights within the same input sequence, where each element attends to all other elements.

> Used in transformers to model relationships in sequences (e.g., words in a sentence).

#### **Cross-Attention**

Computes attention weights between two different sequences. **allowing one sequence to attend to another sequence**.

> Used in tasks like translation where the output sequence (decoder) needs to focus on the input sequence (encoder).

#### **Multi-head Attention**

**Combines multiple self-attention (or cross-attention) heads in parallel, each focusing on different aspects of the input.**

> Used in transformers to improve performance and capture various dependencies simultaneously.

**Multi-headed** because it receiving multiple inputs

**Self-Attention** Self-attention because it feeds back its own sequence

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_8.png "Body image")

**Multi-headed** because it receiving multiple inputs

**Cross-attention** because it feeds sequence inputs from two different sources

## 3 Supervised  vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement

### 3-1 Supervised Learning (SL)

Data that has been labeled for training Task-driven - **make a prediction**

* **When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome.**
* When you need a specific value returned

**<mark>eg. Classification, Regression</mark>**

### 3-2 Unsupervised Learning (SL)

Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling

**Data-driven - recognize a structure or pattern**

* **When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise.**
* When you're trying to make sense of data.

**<mark>eg. Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association</mark>**

### 3-3 Reinforcement Learning (RI)

There is no data, there is an environment and an **ML model generates data any many attempt to reach a goal**

**Decisions-driven - Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation**

### 3-4 Neural Networks and Deep Learning

**Activation Functions**

An algorithm applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output e.g. ReLu

**Dense**

**What are Neural Networks? (NN)**

* Often described as **mimicking the brain**, a **neuron/node represents an algorithm**.
* Data is inputted into a neuron and based on the output the data will be passed to
* one of many other connected neurals.
* **The connection between neurons is weighted**.
* The network is organized in layers.
* **There will be a input layer, 1 to many hidden layers and an output layer.**


**What is Deep Learning?**

A neural network that has **3 or more hidden layers** is considered deep learning.

**What is Feed Forward? (FNN)**

Neural Networks where connections between nodes do not form a cycle (always move forward)

**What is Backpropagation (BP)?**

**Moves backwards through the neural network adjusting weights** to improve outcome on next iteration. This is how a neural net learns.

**Loss Function**

A function that compares the ground truth to the prediction to determine the error rate (how bad the network performed)

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_9.png "Body image")

## 4 What is a GPU?

**A General Processing Unit (GPU)** that is specially designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video **concurrently**.

## 5 Responsible AI

**Responsible AI focuses on ethical, transparent and accountable use of AI** technologies

Microsoft puts into practice Responsible AI via its six Microsoft AI principles


1. **Fairness** - AI systems should treat all people fairly
2. **Reliability and Safety** - AI systems should perform reliably and safely
3. **Privacy and Security** - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
4. **Inclusiveness** - AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
5. **Transparency** - AI systems should be understandable
6. **Accountability** - People should be accountable for AI systems


### 5-1 Fairness

* **AI systems should treat all people fairly**
* AI systems can reinforce existing societal stereotypical
* **Bias can be introduced during the development of a pipeline**

**AI systems that are used to allocate or withhold:**

* opportunities
* resources
* Information

**In domains:**

* Criminal Justice
* Employment and Hiring
* Finance and Credit

eg. an ML model designed to select final applicants **for a hiring pipeline without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity or may result in an unfair advantage**

***Azure ML can tell you how each feature can influence a model's prediction for bias***

**Fairlearn** is an open-source python project to help data scientist to improve fairness in their AI systems

### 5-2 Responsible AI - Reliability and safety

***AI systems should perform reliably and safely***

AI software must be rigorous tested to ensure they work as expected before release to the end user

If there are scenarios where AI is making mistakes its important to release a report **quantified risks and harms** to end-users so they are informed of the short-comings of an AI solution

AI where concern for reliability and safety for humans is critically important:

* Autonomous Vehicle
* AI health diagnosis, AI suggesting prescriptions
* Autonomous Weapon Systems

### 5-3 Responsible AI - Privacy and security

***AI systems should be secure and respect privacy***

AI can require vasts amounts of data to train Deep Learning ML models.

The nature of the ML model may require **personally identifiable information (PII)**

***It is important that we ensure protection of user data that it is not leaked or disclosed***


In some cases ML Models can be run locally on a user's device so their PII remains on their device avoiding that vulnerability

AI Security Principles to detect malicious actors:

* Data Origin and Lineage
* Data Use Internal vs External
* Data Corruption Considerations
* Anomaly detection

### 5-4 Responsible AI - Inclusiveness

**AI systems should empower everyone and engage people**

If we can design AI solutions for the minority of users 

Then we can design AI solutions for the majority of users

**Minority Groups**

* physical ability
* gender
* sexual orientation
* ethnicity
* other factors

### 5-5 Responsible AI - Transparency

**AI systems should be understandable**

Interpretability / Intelligibility is when end-users can understand the behaviour of the UI

Transparency of AI systems can result in

* Mitigating unfairness
* Help developers debug their AI systems
* **Gaining more trust from our users**

Those build AI systems should be:

* open about the why they are using AI
* open about the limitations of their AI systems

Adopting an open-source AI framework can provide transparency (at least from a technical perceptive) on the internal workings of an AI systems

### 5-6 Responsible AI - Accountability

**People should be accountable for AI systems**

**The structure put in place to consistently enacting AI principles and taking them into account**

AI systems should work within:

* framework of governance
* organizational principles

ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined

Principles guide Microsoft on how they **Develop, Sell and Advocate** when working with third-parties and this can push towards regulations towards Al Principles

## 6 Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction

Microsoft has a free web-app that goes through practical scenarios to teach Microsoft Al Principle

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_14.png "Body image")

### 6-1 Responsible AI Standard V2

**The Microsoft Responsible AI Standard** is **playbook** that organizations can use to **implement responsibility controls** to ensure governance of the AI Responsibility

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_15.png "Body image")

### 6-2 AI Transparency Report

**Responsible AI (RAI) Transparency Report** is a **PDF Report** that outlines the steps the Microsoft has taken to be responsible with AI technologies.

The report includes:

* How they build GenAl: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage
* AI Customer Commitments
* Governance of Responsible AI at Microsoft
* and more ...

> AI Transparency Report is not an industry wide report and its just something Microsoft made up.

### Azure OpenAl Services - Deployment Types


When you deploy a model you may have varying deployment type available.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_23.png "Body image")

## What is RAG?

#### **What is RAG?**

Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is **access patterns for retrieving external data to inform an LLM agent** prior to providing a response to the user.

A common RAG pattern is representing information as vectors in a vector database and then
using a Search Engine to vectorize a search term to return relevant documents

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_24.png "Body image")

* Returned information is directly inserted into the context windows of an LLM.
* A RAG access pattern doesn't require a vector database
	* What's important to remember is if you have to fetch external data, than you are utilizing a RAG.

### What is Document Cracking?

**What is Document Cracking?**

* Document cracking is the **process of opening files and extracting content**.
* It's an alternative (and cooler sounding) term for ***Document Extraction***.
* When we say document we are not limiting to just text, could also be images or video.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_25.png "Body image")

Various file mediums, and file formats the LLM can't understand

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_26.png "Body image")

**Parsers** are used to convert data into a format the the LLM can understand.

### What is HNSW?

**Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)** is a **graph-based algorithm** that performs Approximate Nearest Neighbor searches (ANN) in vector databases

* Skip Link Lists (SLL) is a data structure that lets you jump to farther away nodes
* Navigable Small Word (NSW) is graph structure to relate similar nodes. 
* SLL + NWS = HNSW

**HNSW is an efficient algorithm for querying a vector database.**

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_27.png "Body image")

### What is Semantic Ranking?

**Semantic Ranking** are algorithms used to **rerank search queries based on semantic understanding**,

Embeddings are algorithms that vectorize data, and embedding captures semantic understanding, so by using a Vector database ***you don't need a Semantic Reranker.***

Traditional engines use keyword search so they cannot ***contextually understand*** if the result they are returning are correct.

* Companies that want to use their traditional datastores instead of a vectorstore to search against for their
RAGS can get similar results that a vector store would provide.
* A Semantic Rerank can be combined with a vectorstore (which can vield better even better results)
	* Cohere's Reranker claims it works better without even a vectorstore

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_28.png "Body image")

### Azure AI Search

**Azure AI Search** (formally Azure Cognitive Search) is a search engine for both traditional search and for RAG

> It combines a search engine with AI features to provide advanced search capabilities, ideal for
applications needing full-text search, vector similarity search, and hybrid search.

* The **Vectorstore** of the Azure AI Search **is the Index**
* The vectors aren't being stored in CosmosDB

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_29.png "Body image")

Azure AI Search has some additional paid addons:

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

**Optical character recognition (OCR)** is the process of extracting printed or handwritten textinto a digital and editable format

OCR can be applied to:

* photos of street signs
* Products
* Documents
* Invoices
* Bills
* Financial Reports
* Articles
* and more


Azure has two different APIs that can perform OCR: **OCR API and Read API**


**OCR API**


* older recognition model
* supports only images
* executes synchronouslv
	* returning immediately with the detected text
	* Suited for less text
* Support more languages
* Easier to implement


**Read API**

* updated recognition model
* Supports images and PDFs
* Executes asynchronously
	* parallelizes tasks per line for faster results
	* Suited for lots of text
* Supports fewer languages
* A bit more difficult to implement


**OCR is performed via the Computer Vision SDK**

## Introduction to Custom Vision

Within Custom Vision you setup projects and **you need to select a Project Type**

**Classification**

* **Multi-label**
	* When we want to apply many tags to an image
	* Image contains both a Cat and a Dog

* **Multi-class**
	* when we only have one possible tag to apply to an image:
		* It is either a Apple, Banana, Orange

* **Object Detection**
	* When we to detect various objects in an image

You will need to also choose a **Domain**

A Domain is a Microsoft Managed dataset that is used for training the ML model、

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_33.png "Body image")

### Custom Vision - Image Classification Domains

**Classification Domains**

* **General** Optimized for a broad range of image classification tasks. If none of the other specific domains are appropriate, or if you're unsure of which domain to choose, select one of the General domains.
* **General [A1]** Optimized for better accuracy with comparable inference time as General domain.
Recommended for larger datasets or more difficult user scenarios. This domain requires more training time.
* **General [A2]** Optimized for better accuracy with faster inference time than General[A1] and
General domains. Recommended for most datasets. This domain requires less training time than General and General [A1] domains.
* **Food** Optimized for photographs of dishes as you would see them on a restaurant menu. If you
want to classify photographs of individual fruits or vegetables, use the Food domain.
* **Landmarks** Optimized for recognizable landmarks, both natural and artificial. This domain works
best when the landmark is clearly visible in the photograph. This domain works even if the landmark is slightly obstructed by people in front of it.
* **Retail** Optimized for images that are found in a shopping catalog or shopping website. If you want high-precision classifying between dresses, pants, and shirts, use this domain.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_34.png "Body image")

###  Custom Vision - Object Detection Domains

**Object Detection Domains**

**General**

Optimized for a broad range of object detection tasks. If none of the other domains are appropriate, or you are unsure of which domain to choose, select the General domain.

**General [A1]**

* Optimized for better accuracy with comparable inference time as General domain.
* Recommended for more accurate region location needs, larger datasets, or more difficult user scenarios. 
* This domain requires more training time, and results are not deterministic:
	* expect a +-1% mean Average Precision (mAP) difference with the same training data provided.

**Logo**: Optimized for finding brand logos in images.

**Products on shelves**: Optimized for detecting and classifying products on shelves.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_35.png "Body image")

### Custom Vision - Object Detection

**For Object Detection** you apply tags to objects in an image for data labeling

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_36.png "Body image")

### Custom Vision - Training

When you are ready to train you model you have two options:

* **Quick Training** - trains quickly but can be less accurate
* **Advanced Training** - increase the compute time to improve your results

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_37.png "Body image")

With each iteration of training our ML model will improve the evaluation metrics **(precision and recall**) 

**The probability threshold value** determines when to stop training when our evaluation metrics meet our desired threshold

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_38.png "Body image")

Once the **Classification** training job is complete we will get a report of the evaluation metrics **outcome**

**Precision**

* being exact and accurate
* select items that are relevant

**Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)**

* How many relevant items returned

**Average Precision (AP)**

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_39.png "Body image")

### Custom Vision - Quick Test

Before deploying our final trained model that can be invoked via an API Endpoint 

It is good practice to test our ML model using the **Quick Test** feature

### Custom Vision - Publish

To deploy our ML model to be accessible using our API Key and Endpoint we need to trigger the **Publish** action.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_40.png "Body image")

###  ***Custom Vision - Smart Labeler***

When you have a very large dataset you can use Smart Labeler to predict labels.

Smart Labeler only works if you have trained the label

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai102_1_41.png "Body image")

Smart labeler is when you want to increase your training set, and want to ML-assisted labeling to speed up this process.

LUIS is accessed via its own isolate domain at luis.ai

LUIS utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

NLU is the ability to transform a linguistic statement to a representation that enables you to understand your users naturally


LUIS is intended to focus on **intention and extraction**:

* What the user wants
* What they are talking about

### A LUIS application is composed of a schema

This schema is autogenerated for you when you use the LUIS.ai web interface

The schema defines:

* **intentions** - what the user is asking for
	* a LUIS app always contains a None Intent
* **entities** - what parts of the intent is used to determine the answer
* **utterances** - Examples of user input that includes intent and entities to train the ML model to match predictions against real user input
	* An intent requires one or more example utterance for training
	* It is recommended to have 15-30 example utterances
	* To explicitly train to ignore an utterance use the None Intent

	
* Intents **classify** user utterances
* Entities **extract** data from utterance

> Example Utterance
