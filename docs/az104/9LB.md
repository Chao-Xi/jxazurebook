### **Azure Load Balancer (LB)**

Azure Load Balancer is a networking solution for distributing traffic between backend compute.

**virtual machines and virtual machines scale sets.**

Backend compute set of virtual machines that **offers up the same web server and website.** load balancer solution to balance the traffic for that single web solution.

* **Layer 4 load balancing (TCP/UDP)** 
	* port 80 for TCP
	* port 443 for HTTPS
* High availability
* **Backend resources must be redundant**
* **Virtual machines and VMSS(virtual machines scale sets)**

**Internal traffic**, doesn't have to just be external from the public internet, it can be internal within our own networks. A database solution as an internal load-balancing solution for a application

### Components of an Azure Load Balancer

* **Frontend IP**

Private or public endpoint for accessing the load balancing solution.

Have an accessible either public or private endpoint for the frontend IP of this Azure load balancing solution.

* **Backend Pool**

Compute solution underlying the load balancer

* **Health Probe**

Probe that periodically checks the health of the 
backend pool to determine available nodes.

* **Rules**

**Load balancing or NAT rules configured for allowing inbound/outbound access.**

Load balancing rules that tell how we're going to balance traffic between our backend compute, or **our NAT rules for both inbound and outbound rules to allow access over things like SSH, from our public IP address of our load balancer, and then NATing** that to one of the backend computes inside that load balancer.
