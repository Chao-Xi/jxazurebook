## 1 Understanding Azure Resource Manager

### 1-1 What Are Clouds Made Of?

Resources

* An entity managed by Azure
* **Virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks**
* Logically grouped into a resource group
	* **lifecycle**
	* **security**
	* **environments**(dev/test/production)

![Alt Image Text](../images/az104_1_1.png "Body image")

<mark>Resource groups are ultimately a logical container for grouping all of our resources that we have running inside of Azure</mark>.

we can group these resources based on various things, such as **lifecycle**, maybe some of these resources are part of a workload that will share a common lifecycle when it is created, managed, and destroyed.

Maybe we want to group resources based on **security**, so we can **control access** based on resource groups. 

Maybe we want to break it down into something different like **dev environments, test environments, and maybe even production**.

**Azure Subscription**

* Logical construct that groups together **resource groups and associated resources**
* **Billing unit for the Azure cloud**
	* we pay our bills on a per-subscription basis depending on our billing model. For example, pay as you go.
	* For marketing or production, or maybe dev/test.
* **Controlled by Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**

**Describing Azure Resource Manager**

Azure Resource Manager is the top-level resource in the Azure cloud. **It is simply the orchestration layer that allows us to manage resources in the Azure cloud**.


Interact with these resources

* Azure Portal
* Azure CLI
* Azure PowerShell


**Azure Resource Manager** is not interacting with the resources themselves, but rather, **it's interacting with and connecting to these resource providers that are associated with specific resources**

So we know that **we use some REST API endpoints to interact with the Azure Resource Manager**, and we make **requests for specific operations, and then the Resource Manager forwards these requests to the appropriate resource providers** depending on the resource that we're trying to perform in operation on.

* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the orchestration layer for managing the Azure cloud
* Uses REST API endpoints

> ARM connects to the resource provider
> 
> Resource provider completes the request


**What prevents someone from managing resources that don't belong to their organization?**

![Alt Image Text](../images/az104_1_4.png "Body image")

Now, Azure approaches everything from a **identity-centric security method**, and we're using Azure AD, Azure AD is our identity and access management resource inside of Azure. 

>  Our subscription here has a trust relationship between TenantA
> 
> If there is another tenant B out there, it won't be able to do anything because **it doesn't have the trust relationship that the tenant that we've established a trust relationship** between our subscription does.


**Exam Tips**

* **Resources are Azure - managed entities**, like virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.
* Resources are contained in **resource groups**.
* **Resource groups** are contained in **subscriptions**.
* You can use **REST API** endpoints to manage Azure through **Azure Resource Manager**.
* Azure Resource Manager is a management service.
* Each **resource** has a **resource provider**.

### Chatgpt summary



1. **Azure Resources**: Resources are the smallest units in the Azure cloud, managed entities like virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks that provide functionality for tasks such as compute, data storage, and networking.

2. **Resource Groups**: Logical containers for grouping resources in Azure based on factors like lifecycle, security, or environment (e.g., dev, test, production) to manage and organize resources efficiently.

3. **Subscriptions**: Boundaries for actual resources in Azure, grouping resource groups and associated resources, used as billing units to determine Azure Cloud costs based on accumulated costs within the subscription.

4. **Azure Resource Manager**: Top-level resource in Azure, an orchestration layer that allows management of Azure resources using tools like Azure portal, CLI, and PowerShell through REST API endpoints, interacting with resource providers for specific operations.

5. **Identity and Access Management**: Azure adopts an identity-centric security approach using Azure AD, a standalone identity and access management resource separate from subscriptions, where tenants (e.g., TenantA) with trust relationships manage resources securely across subscriptions.

Key Takeaways:

- Understanding Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions as essential components in managing Azure services and costs.
- Utilizing REST API endpoints to interact with Azure resources through Azure Resource Manager, the top-level management service in Azure.
- Identity and access management through Azure AD ensures secure resource management across subscriptions.



## 2 Using Azure Portal and Cloud Shell

What is the Azure Portal?

* **Login portal for the Azure cloud**
* **Create and manage Azure resources**
* **Uses Cloud Shell**
	* Using Azure CLI and PowerShell

## 4 Using ARM Templates

Explaining Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

![Alt Image Text](../images/az104_1_18.png "Body image")

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
	* Azure Resource Manager templates, so we create these JSON files that are known as ARM templates, and this provides us Infrastructure as Code.
* **Deploy environments quickly**
	*  So we codify our infrastructure, and **using this ARM template, we can pass it into the Azure Resource Manager for deployment,** it will find the necessary providers, and it will quickly deploy our environments at **various scopes, such as a subscription or a resource group**.
* **Repeatable deployments**


### **Components of ARM Templates**

![Alt Image Text](../images/az104_1_19.png "Body image")

* The **<mark>parameters and variables</mark>** components are used to pass information to the template
	* Such as a username or maybe a VM SKU that we want to use for the virtual machine deployment that we're running in an ARM template.
	* Variables are a little bit different in that they're not dynamic, **these are things that we just hardcode into the template**.
* The **resources component** is used to define resources in the template
	* Resource blocks that we can use to outline the specific resources we want to deploy and their properties, and **we can use those parameters and variables in this section to define some of those properties, either dynamically with parameters or hardcoded with variables**
* The outputs component is used to return output from the execution of the template

### **Get Template > Deploy > Verify**

### Gpt summary

Summary of the key points from the article regarding ARM templates:

1. ARM templates are JSON files used in Azure Resource Manager to provide Infrastructure as Code.
2. They allow for codifying infrastructure, enabling repeatable deployments at various scopes like subscription or resource group.
3. Parameters and variables are components used to pass information into the template, with parameters being dynamic and variables being hardcoded.
4. The resources section defines the resources to deploy, including their properties that can be defined using parameters or variables.
5. The outputs component returns information from the template execution, such as returning IP addresses.
6. ARM templates enable quick deployment of modular environments in Azure and support nested templates for deploying resources efficiently.
7. Demonstrations involve obtaining a template from a repository, deploying it in the Azure portal, configuring parameters, validating the deployment, and reviewing the created resources.

List of exam points from the article:

- Definition of ARM templates and their role in Infrastructure as Code.
- Explanation of parameters and variables in ARM templates.
- Importance of the resources section for defining resources to deploy.
- Use of the outputs component to return information from the template execution.
- Deployment process in Azure portal, including configuration and validation steps.
- Scope of ARM template deployment at various levels such as subscription or resource group.
- Ability to create repeatable and modular environments using ARM templates.
- Support for nested ARM templates for efficient deployment of resources.

This summary covers the key concepts and exam points related to ARM templates as discussed in the article.
