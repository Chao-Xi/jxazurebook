## 1 Azure Monitoring Fundamentals

### 1-1 Collecting Data with Azure Monitor

Here's a concise summary of the Azure Monitor data collection article:

1.  **Diverse Data Sources:** Azure Monitor collects data from numerous sources including:
    *   Azure resources (VMs, SQL DB, networks, etc.)
    *   Applications (custom apps, OS info from VMs)
    *   Azure Subscription (health/availability)
    *   Azure Tenant (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID)
    *   Hybrid environments (e.g., on-prem SQL with Azure agents)

3.  **Primary Data Types:**
    *   **Metrics:** Numerical time-series data for real-time/short-term performance monitoring (e.g., CPU%, disk I/O, memory pressure).
    *   **Logs:** Detailed event/activity records (e.g., security logs, application logs, Windows/Linux system logs, resource state changes).
    *   **Traces:** Data for tracking request flows in distributed applications (e.g., via Application Insights).
    *   **Changes:** Tracks modifications to Azure resources over time.

*Focus:* The article (and course) emphasizes **Metrics** (real-time performance) and **Logs** (detailed troubleshooting) as the most common and impactful data types.

4.  **Enabling Collection:**
    *   **Automatic:** Basic data collection starts immediately when an Azure resource is created.
    *   **Enhanced Setup:** Requires configuration for deeper insights:
        *   Enable diagnostic logging on resources (e.g., Azure SQL DB).
        *   Install Azure Monitor agents on VMs.
        *   Use the **Data Collector API** to send data from custom applications (web apps, functions, mobile apps).


### 1-2 Taking Action on Azure Monitor Data

#### 1. **Data Analysis Tools**

- **Metrics Explorer**: Visualizes real-time numerical data (CPU%, memory, disk I/O) via charts to track performance trends and set threshold-based alerts.
- **Log Analytics**: Performs deep investigation using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** or a point-and-click interface. Combines logs (Windows events, Linux syslogs, errors) for troubleshooting complex issues.
- **Key Difference**:  
  - *Metrics*: Real-time resource health (automatic collection).  
  - *Logs*: Detailed event analysis (may require setup like Log Analytics workspace).

> üí° **Core Value**: Azure Monitor closes the loop from data collection ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí automated action.

### 1-4 Demo: Configuring Alerts and Notifications

#### üîî **Alert Creation Methods**
1. **Portal Setup (GUI):**
   - Created **Action Group** (`pstestgroup`) with email notifications.
   - Defined an alert rule (`Cpu80Percent`) for a VM (`pstest1`):
     - **Condition:** `Max CPU > 80%` over 1 minute.
     - **Severity:** Warning.
   - Enabled email notifications via the action group.

2. **CLI Method (Azure Cloud Shell):**
   - Used `az monitor metrics alert create` to create an alert for another VM (`pstest2`):
     - **Condition:** `CPU > 40%`.
     - **Severity:** Informational (level 3).

```
az monitor metrics alert create -n "Cpu40Percent" --resource-group "1-b4e6871e-playground-sandbox" --scopes $VMID --condition
"max percentage CPU > 40" --description "Virtual machine is running at or greater than 40% CPU utilization" --evaluation-frequency 1m ‚Äî-window-size 1m -- severity 3
```

---

#### ‚ö° **Alert Verification**
- Ran a load-generation script to trigger alerts.
- **Results:**
  - Both alerts fired: `CPU > 40%` (pstest2) and `CPU > 80%` (pstest1).
  - Email received for the 80% alert (configured via action group).
- Incident details showed:
  - CPU progression graphs.
  - Options to update incident status (New/Acknowledged/Closed).

---

####Demo: Analyzing with Azure Monitor Logs üí° **Key Takeaways**
- **Action Groups:** Centralize notifications (email/SMS) for reuse across alerts.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Use GUI (portal) for one-off setups or CLI (`az`) for automation/scaling.
- **Real-Time Response:** Alerts provide:
  - Immediate visibility into thresholds (e.g., CPU spikes).
  - Contextual data for troubleshooting.
  - Notifications to streamline team response.
  
###  1-5 Demo: Analyzing with Azure Monitor Logs


Here's a concise summary of the Azure Monitor Logs analysis demo:

### üîç **Three Approaches to Log Analysis**
1. **Pre-Built Queries (Zero-Code):**
   - Accessed via **Queries Hub** (scoped to resources like VMs).
   - Example: "Heartbeat" query to verify VM connectivity (`pstest1`, `pstest2`).
   - Instantly shows key details: computer name, IP, last check-in time.

2. **Simple Mode (Point-and-Click GUI):**
   - Visually build queries using filters:
     - Start with table (e.g., `Event` for Windows logs).
     - Add filters: `Source ‚Üí EventLog` ‚Üí Specific computer (e.g., `pstest1`).
   - No KQL knowledge needed ‚Äì ideal for quick ad-hoc analysis.

3. **KQL Mode (Advanced Custom Queries):**

   - Write Kusto Query Language scripts for deep investigation.
   - Example query:  
     ```kql
     Event | where EventLog == "Security" | where EventID == 4625
     ```
   - **Use Case**: Track failed logins (`EventID 4625`) across all VMs, revealing details like attacker account names (e.g., `fakeuser2`).

---

### üí° **Key Workflow Insights**

- **Scope First**: Start by selecting a resource group/VM to target analysis.
- **Progress from Simple ‚Üí Advanced**:  
  - Pre-built queries ‚Üí GUI filtering ‚Üí Custom KQL.
- **KQL Advantages**:  
  - SQL-like syntax (familiar for many users).  
  - Enables complex cross-VM correlation (e.g., security threat hunting).  
- **Unified Interface**: All approaches accessible in the same **Log Analytics** workspace.

---

### üöÄ **Getting Started Tips**
- **New Users**: Leverage pre-built queries + Simple mode to avoid syntax barriers.  
- **Security/Admin Teams**: Use KQL to audit events (e.g., failed logins, resource access).  
- **Troubleshooting**: Combine log types (application/security/system) for root-cause analysis.  

> **Demo Outcome**: From verifying VM health to investigating security events, Azure Monitor Logs adapts to user expertise‚Äîdelivering value immediately. üïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è


## 2 Monitoring Microsoft Azure Resources and Workloads

### 2-1 Introducing Azure Diagnostics Monitoring

Here's a concise summary of the Azure diagnostics monitoring concepts:

### ‚öïÔ∏è **Service Health & Resource Health**

- **Purpose**: Personalized view of Azure platform issues affecting *your* resources (e.g., Microsoft-side outages).
- **Key Features**:
  - World map showing regional service status.
  - Historical issue tracking (resolved incidents).
  - Determines if problems are Azure-related (vs. your configuration).
- **Use Case**: "Sanity check" before troubleshooting internal issues.

---

### üìä **Two Core Monitoring Streams**
1. **Metrics**  
   - **What**: Numerical time-series data (sampled periodically).  
   - **Examples**: 
     - *Infrastructure*: VM CPU%, disk space, network I/O.  
     - *Apps*: HTTP errors, request rates.  
   - **Analysis Tools**: Metrics Explorer, dashboards, alerts.  

2. **Logs**  
   - **What**: Event-based records (discrete occurrences).  
   - **Types**:  
     - **Activity Log**: Subscription-level *control-plane* audits (e.g., "VM deleted").  
     - **Diagnostic Logs**: Resource-level *data-plane* events (e.g., VM guest OS logs).  
   - **Storage**:  
     - Metrics ‚Üí Tables  
     - Logs ‚Üí Blobs (e.g., IIS logs) or Log Analytics.  
   - **Analysis Tools**: Log Analytics, KQL queries.  

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Enabling Diagnostics**
- **Data Capture**: Send both metrics and logs to:
  - Azure Storage (tables/blobs).
  - Log Analytics workspace.
  - Event Hubs (streaming).
- **Guest OS Monitoring**: Enable for VMs to collect:
  - Performance counters (CPU/memory).
  - IIS/application logs.
  - System event logs.

---

### üéØ **Monitoring Goals**
1. **Break/Fix**: Rapid incident response.
2. **Optimization**: Performance tuning (e.g., scaling based on trends).
3. **Security**: Detect anomalies/breaches.
4. **Proactive Management**: Address issues before they impact users.

> **Key Insight**: Azure diagnostics provide critical visibility despite no physical access to datacenters. Start by defining *why* you need monitoring (e.g., SLA compliance, cost control).
