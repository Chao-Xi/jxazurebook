3.  **Primary Data Types:**
    *   **Metrics:** Numerical time-series data for real-time/short-term performance monitoring (e.g., CPU%, disk I/O, memory pressure).
    *   **Logs:** Detailed event/activity records (e.g., security logs, application logs, Windows/Linux system logs, resource state changes).
    *   **Traces:** Data for tracking request flows in distributed applications (e.g., via Application Insights).
    *   **Changes:** Tracks modifications to Azure resources over time.

*Focus:* The article (and course) emphasizes **Metrics** (real-time performance) and **Logs** (detailed troubleshooting) as the most common and impactful data types.

4.  **Enabling Collection:**
    *   **Automatic:** Basic data collection starts immediately when an Azure resource is created.
    *   **Enhanced Setup:** Requires configuration for deeper insights:
        *   Enable diagnostic logging on resources (e.g., Azure SQL DB).
        *   Install Azure Monitor agents on VMs.
        *   Use the **Data Collector API** to send data from custom applications (web apps, functions, mobile apps).

   - Accessed via **Queries Hub** (scoped to resources like VMs).
   - Example: "Heartbeat" query to verify VM connectivity (`pstest1`, `pstest2`).
   - Instantly shows key details: computer name, IP, last check-in time.

2. **Simple Mode (Point-and-Click GUI):**
   - Visually build queries using filters:
     - Start with table (e.g., `Event` for Windows logs).
     - Add filters: `Source → EventLog` → Specific computer (e.g., `pstest1`).
   - No KQL knowledge needed – ideal for quick ad-hoc analysis.

3. **KQL Mode (Advanced Custom Queries):**

   - Write Kusto Query Language scripts for deep investigation.
   - Example query:  
     ```kql
     Event | where EventLog == "Security" | where EventID == 4625
     ```
   - **Use Case**: Track failed logins (`EventID 4625`) across all VMs, revealing details like attacker account names (e.g., `fakeuser2`).

## 2 Monitoring Microsoft Azure Resources and Workloads

### 2-1 Introducing Azure Diagnostics Monitoring

Here's a concise summary of the Azure diagnostics monitoring concepts:

### ⚕️ **Service Health & Resource Health**

- **Purpose**: Personalized view of Azure platform issues affecting *your* resources (e.g., Microsoft-side outages).
- **Key Features**:
  - World map showing regional service status.
  - Historical issue tracking (resolved incidents).
  - Determines if problems are Azure-related (vs. your configuration).
- **Use Case**: "Sanity check" before troubleshooting internal issues.

---

### 📊 **Two Core Monitoring Streams**
1. **Metrics**  
   - **What**: Numerical time-series data (sampled periodically).  
   - **Examples**: 
     - *Infrastructure*: VM CPU%, disk space, network I/O.  
     - *Apps*: HTTP errors, request rates.  
   - **Analysis Tools**: Metrics Explorer, dashboards, alerts.  

2. **Logs**  
   - **What**: Event-based records (discrete occurrences).  
   - **Types**:  
     - **Activity Log**: Subscription-level *control-plane* audits (e.g., "VM deleted").  
     - **Diagnostic Logs**: Resource-level *data-plane* events (e.g., VM guest OS logs).  
   - **Storage**:  
     - Metrics → Tables  
     - Logs → Blobs (e.g., IIS logs) or Log Analytics.  
   - **Analysis Tools**: Log Analytics, KQL queries.  

---

### ⚙️ **Enabling Diagnostics**
- **Data Capture**: Send both metrics and logs to:
  - Azure Storage (tables/blobs).
  - Log Analytics workspace.
  - Event Hubs (streaming).
- **Guest OS Monitoring**: Enable for VMs to collect:
  - Performance counters (CPU/memory).
  - IIS/application logs.
  - System event logs.

---

### 🎯 **Monitoring Goals**
1. **Break/Fix**: Rapid incident response.
2. **Optimization**: Performance tuning (e.g., scaling based on trends).
3. **Security**: Detect anomalies/breaches.
4. **Proactive Management**: Address issues before they impact users.

> **Key Insight**: Azure diagnostics provide critical visibility despite no physical access to datacenters. Start by defining *why* you need monitoring (e.g., SLA compliance, cost control).
