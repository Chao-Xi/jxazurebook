* **Region selection for log analytics workspace can help you save egress cost.**


The importance of choosing the correct region during workspace creation affects egress costs and overall efficiency. This decision can significantly impact the financial aspect of your Azure resources.


### 2-3 What is Retention Period?

#### **Daily Cap**

1. Setting up daily cap for Log Analytics workspace.
2. Whenever the threshold is reached, the collection of data is stopped for the day.
3. Whenever daily cap limit is reached a warning is shown on azure portal, as well as an event is generated in operations table of the log analytics workspace.
4. Every workspace will have a reset time, which will be different for each workspace.
5. Initially, this daily cap was not affecting the collection of security data related to Microsoft sentinel and Microsoft defender for cloud.
6. Starting from September 18th â€™23 these exclusions are also removed.
7. The reset hour for the workspace is shown, but it can be changed.

**Default Tables**

## 2 What is DCR - Data Collection Rule?

![Alt Image Text](../images/log1_1_24.png "Body image")

**Data Collection Rule**

Data collection rule is basically a contiguration, which lets the azure monitor agent know, 

what type of data must be captured and forwarded to data ingestion pipeline, then are here any transformation which must be applied before the data gets ingested to the workspace and where exactly the data must be ingested, precisely speaking to which table of the workspace.
          
Data collection rules can be created for Windows, Linux and other platforms as well where you might use data ingestion API of log analytics workspace.


**Data Collection Rule can only be applied to Azure VM or Azure Arc-enabled servers.**

**Which means that you must onboard your on-prem, aws or GCP virtual machines to Azure Arc before you can deploy Azure Monitor Agent.**
