- Compliance requirements may necessitate the retention of logs for specific periods.
- Centralized storage solutions facilitate the long-term retention of logs for audit and regulatory purposes.
- Different log formats like WEF, CEF, and syslog require dedicated tables in a centralized repository to manage diverse data effectively. Each format has unique structures that need specific handling.
- After capturing data in a centralized repository, it is essential to analyze and derive insights from it.
- This analysis can lead to actionable dashboards and alerts based on defined conditions.


### **Data structure**

- Each workspace contains multiple tables that are organized into separate columns with multiple rows of data. 
- Each table is defined by a unique set of columns.
- Rows of data provided by the data source share those columns. 
- Log queries define columns of data to retrieve and provide output to different features of Azure Monitor and other services that use workspaces.


### Applications of Azure log analytics workspace

- Azure log analytics workspace is the **environment used by Azure Monitor for saving data**.
- Azure log analytics workspace is used for **data ingestion for Microsoft Sentinel as well as Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
- Enablement of Diagnostics settings for azure resource can be **done by using Azure log analytics workspace**.
- From compliance standpoint, Log analytics workspace can be used to ingest and save data from multiple solutions for up to 7 years.


Log analytics workspace serves as a centralized repository for ingesting data across various enterprise solutions, facilitating data analysis and visualization. It supports performance monitoring, security monitoring, and diagnostics for Azure resources.

- Data ingestion can occur through agents, connectors, or collectors, ensuring comprehensive data collection from network devices and security applications. This process is crucial for data accuracy and completeness.
- Once data is ingested, it undergoes transformations to filter out unnecessary information, allowing users to visualize key insights through dashboards. Visualization helps in making data-driven decisions effectively.
- Log analytics workspace can integrate with Microsoft Sentinel to automate responses based on captured observations. This automation enhances the efficiency of security monitoring and incident response.

Azure Log Analytics Workspace serves as a centralized repository for data ingestion, enabling the use of various services like Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It organizes data into tables with defined columns and rows for efficient management and retrieval.

- Data organization in Azure Log Analytics involves multiple tables with unique columns and rows, allowing for structured data management. This aids in efficient querying and reporting.
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace is crucial for Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud, which rely on it for data ingestion and functionality. This integration enhances the security monitoring capabilities.
- The retention period for data in the Log Analytics Workspace can extend up to seven years, ensuring compliance and long-term data accessibility. Users can customize retention settings for specific tables.



## 2 Microsoft Azure Log Analytics Workspace - Detail

### 2-1 How to create a log analytics workspace?

### 2-2 How to manage commitment tiers of log analytics workspace?

Cost

* ***There is no cost for creation of log analytics workspace, you will only be charged for the data which is ingested in log analytics**
* **You are also charged based on the retention period that you choose**.
* **Region selection for log analytics workspace can help you save egress cost.**


The importance of choosing the correct region during workspace creation affects egress costs and overall efficiency. This decision can significantly impact the financial aspect of your Azure resources.


### 2-3 What is Retention Period?

#### **Daily Cap**

1. Setting up daily cap for Log Analytics workspace.
2. Whenever the threshold is reached, the collection of data is stopped for the day.
3. Whenever daily cap limit is reached a warning is shown on azure portal, as well as an event is generated in operations table of the log analytics workspace.
4. Every workspace will have a reset time, which will be different for each workspace.
5. Initially, this daily cap was not affecting the collection of security data related to Microsoft sentinel and Microsoft defender for cloud.
6. Starting from September 18th ’23 these exclusions are also removed.
7. The reset hour for the workspace is shown, but it can be changed.

**Default Tables**

### How to define retention settings for each table?

**Data Retention**

- The time for which your data will be saved.
- For example - i**f you want to save data for 2 years then total retention period will be 2 years**.

**Table Plan**

**Basic and Analytics**

* Managing commitment tiers is crucial as it dictates the data ingestion capacity and associated costs. Proper planning is necessary to avoid unexpected charges during data usage.
* **There are no upfront costs for creating a workspace; charges apply only when data is ingested. This allows for flexible budgeting as you scale your data usage**.
* Data ingestion and retention choices in log analytics workspaces significantly impact costs and functionality. U
* hoosing the right data retention period is crucial as it directly affects the costs associated with log analytics in Azure. Different retention options come with varying price points.
* Setting a daily cap on data ingestion can help manage costs but requires careful planning to avoid disruptions in data collection. Users must be aware of their data usage patterns.
* Recent changes have removed exclusions for certain Microsoft services from the daily cap, meaning all data types are now subject to ingestion limits. This impacts how security data is managed.
* Data retention in workspaces includes two key types: **interactive retention and archival retention. The total retention period combines these two, allowing for customized settings for each table**.
* Interactive retention determines how long data is available for queries, while archival retention is for compliance and requires specific retrieval methods. Each workspace has default settings for these.
* Users can customize the retention settings for individual tables within a workspace, allowing for flexibility in data management according to specific requirements or compliance needs.
* Workspace default settings can be inherited by all tables, meaning any changes made to the retention period will automatically apply to them. This ensures consistent data management.

### How to manage schema for a specific table?

### Monitoring log analytics workspace health


- Data retention policies include interactive retention and archival periods, which can be customized for different table plans.
- Interactive retention periods vary based on the chosen table plan, with basic plans offering a fixed retention of eight days. Archival periods can extend up to seven years for basic plans.
- Analytics table plans provide more flexibility, allowing interactive retention periods from 30 days to two years. This option can significantly affect data ingestion costs and query capabilities.
- Limitations exist for basic plans, where certain KQL queries, such as the join operator, cannot be utilized. Awareness of these restrictions is important for effective data analysis.


### Portal Walkthrough


1. Customizing table schemas and managing transformations are critical for effective data management. This allows for tailored data handling and better query performance in databases.
2. Understanding the naming conventions like suffixes is essential when creating or modifying tables. These conventions help in identifying the type of tables created.
3. Editing transformations enables the removal and updating of unnecessary columns. This customization can improve data quality and query efficiency significantly.
4. Monitoring workspace health is vital for identifying and addressing issues. System notifications and console highlights provide immediate awareness of any potential problems.
