## 1 Introduction to DevOps


DevOps is an approach that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) with the goal to enhance the speed and reliability of software delivery. 

**It focuses on continuous improvement, automation, and collaboration between teams that were once siloed, aiming to shorten the time from development to operation.**


The process includes frequent code versions, which allows for incremental improvements to applications and systems.


The ultimate goal of DevOps is to create a culture and environment where **building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.**

#### Why DevOps?


DevOps eliminates the inefficiencies, miscommunications, and delays that arise from the traditional gap between development and operations teams.

It creates a collaborative culture that accelerates and improves software delivery.

**Key Challenges Addressed by DevOps:**


- Miscommunication and Collaboration Gaps: Enhances communication and collaboration, reducing misunderstandings and accelerating the release process.
- **Conflicting Goals**: Aligns the goals of Dev and Ops teams towards quick, reliable, and high-quality software delivery.
- **Manual Processes and Bottlenecks**: Advocates for automation to decrease manual effort, errors, and delays.
- **Streamlined Processes**: Automation leads to fewer errors, shorter deployment times, and improved software quality.

The Role of a DevOps Engineer:

**A DevOps engineer facilitates this collaboration and automation,** focusing on:


**Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Establishing pipelines that automate code integration, testing, and deployment, ensuring rapid, reliable software releases.


**Infrastructure as Code (laC):** Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code to increase efficiency and consistency.

**Monitoring and Operations**: Implementing monitoring solutions to track application and infrastructure performance, **ensuring high availability and reliability.**

**Transition to Cloud Infrastructure**: Many organizations are transitioning to cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to cut costs and improve manageability, offering intuitive tools for network and security settings but necessitating knowledge of platform-specific features.

#### Tools and Technologies:


**Version Control (e.g., Git):** Essential for managing code changes and facilitating team collaboration.

**Use Agile and Lean Techniques:** For planning, sprint isolation, and capacity management.

**Containerization (e.g., Docker):** Enables scalable deployments with lightweight containers that are faster and simpler to configure than traditional virtual machines.

**Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes):** Efficiently manages containerized applications at scale

CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI): Automate the software delivery process, from code integration to deployment.

**laC Tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible):** Automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.

**Monitoring and Logging (e.g., Prometheus):** Provides insights into application performance and operational health.

**Public and Hybrid Clouds streamline operations**, offering scalable infrastructure with laas for seamless app migration and PaaS to enhance productivity through sophisticated tools.

Examples of DevOps technologies across different DevOps stages include:

**Planning:**

Azure Boards, GitHub, Atlassian Jira

**Continuous Integration:** **Azure Repos, GitHub Repos, SonarQube**, Selenium, OWASP ZA, NuGet,

**Continuous Delivery: Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Bicep, Terraform**, Jenkins, RedHat Ansible, Chef, Puppet

**Operations: Azure Monitor, Azure Automation,** Microsoft Power BI

**Collaboration and feedback: Azure DevOps Wikis, GitHub Wikis**, GitHub Discussions, Microsoft Teams,

### DevOps vs Traditional IT

#### **Time**

* **DevOps teams spend one-third more time** **improving systems** to avoid tech issues than **traditional IT.**
* Less time is needed for administrative tasks because **DevOps uses more automated tools and helpful scripts**.
* This saved time allows for a **33% increase** in enhancing their tech infrastructure.
* They also have **15%** more time for learning and training, boosting their

#### Speed and data

- DevOps groups are typically **small and adaptable,** driven by creativity and speed.
- One of the main goal of DevOps is agility, aiming for swift completion of tasks.
- **Traditional IT** operations typically have less feedback data, focusing only on the immediate task.
- IT operations often have to handle unexpected downstream issues they didn't see coming.
- Cloud DevOps is more effective in **delivering business applications** due to its quick pace.
- Traditional IT must strive to keep up with the rapid changes and demands of the business world.

#### Recuperation and crunch time

DevOps teams focus on **readiness for failures** and have strategies like ongoing testing and real-time alerts.

These strategies mean they can **address issues quickly and keep systems running smoothly**.

Traditional IT may need more time to recover from setbacks because they might not have these proactive measures in place.

Fast recovery in DevOps is often helped using automated systems and flexible infrastructure setups.

**Software distribution**

- DevOps teams take roughly **37 minutes to deploy software**.
- Traditional IT operations typically need about **85 minutes for the same task.**
- This indicates DevOps teams can release software more than **twice** as quickly as traditional IT teams.

| Aspect | DevOps Advantage |
|:----|:---:|
| Product Reliability | Reduced likelihood of failure| 
| Adaptability | Enhanced flexibility and support |
| Market Responsiveness | Decreased time to market |
| Team Productivity | Greater efficiency in teams |
| Vision Clarity | More defined product vision within teams |


## 2 Agile

**Agile** is a philosophy in software development that emphasizes **incremental progress, collaboration, and flexibility**. It revolves around the idea of breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable sections called **iterations or sprints.**

Teams work in these short bursts to produce tangible results regularly, allowing for frequent reassessment and adjustment.

This approach enables a quick response to change and promotes continuous improvement, both in the product and the process used to create it.

The term "**agile methodology"** refers to the specific frameworks and practices that embody the Agile philosophy, **such as Scrum, and Kanban**.

These methodologies provide the structure and tools for teams to execute Agile principles effectively.

They include techniques for planning and tracking progress, **such as stand-up meetings, sprints, and visual boards, all designed to enhance team coordination and project transparency.**

### Agile Development

**Diligent Backlog Refinement**: This means organizing the list of upcoming work, **prioritizing the most important tasks, and clarifying them**. 

Product owners are key in preparing for future sprints by providing **clear goals.**

**Integrating Early and Often:** By using Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (Cl/CD), teams automate their workflows, which speeds up coding, testing, and deployment. **This helps catch and fix problems early.**

**Minimizing Technical Debt**: Just like unwanted financial debt, technical debt happens when taking shortcuts, which may later require code fixes.

It's important to find a good mix of adding **new features and fixing these issues, needing careful planning and fixing these issues, needing careful planning and discipline.**


**Agile Development encompasses various methods** that follow the **Agile Manifesto's core ideas.**

It's about teams working together, managing themselves, and using practices that best suit their project's needs to gradually improve their software.

In agile development, teams aim to produce fully working and high-quality parts of the software at the end of every sprint.

This means they **<mark>must write code, test it, and make sure everything is of good quality</mark>** within each sprint's short timeframe.

The key success factors for Agile development teams:

- **Diligent backlog refinement**
- **Integrating early and often**
- **Minimizing technical debt**
