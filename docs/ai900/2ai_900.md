**INTRODUCTION TO AZURE MACHINE LEARNING**

Let's start with an introduction to Azure Machine Learning designer, a drag-and-drop interface for training and deploying machine learning models without writing any code.

You'll learn about the fundamentals of machine learning, data preparation, and model evaluation, covering classification, regression, and clustering

**AZURE AI SERVICES SUITE**

Next, we'll explore the Azure AI services suite, a collection of pre-built AI components.


We'll delve into its computer vision capabilities, natural language processing capabilities, and the
Azure OpenAI Service, which allows you to create applications using OpenAI's generative AI models

### 2 Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

**HOW MACHINE LEARNING WORKS**

Machine learning is transforming industries, from cybersecurity to customer service 

At its core, its about feeding real-world data into a program to make predictions.

For example, it can analyze emails to predict if they're spam or not.

**CREATING AN AZURE MACHINE LEARNING WORKSPACE**

To get started, we'll create an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

In the Azure portal, we'll set up a workspace and a compute target to run our machine learning experiment.

**EVALUATING THE MODEL**

After training the model, we'll use the **Score Model and Evaluate Model modules** to see how accurate our predictions are.


### 3 OVERFITTING

Lets say We built a model with 98% accuracy, which sounds impressive, but there's a catch.

* **WHAT IS OVERFITTING?**

The problem is that we used the same data to evaluate the model that we used to train it.

**This can lead to overfitting, where the model perfectly fits the training data but performs poorly with new data**.

* **HOW TO AVOID OVERFITTING**

One critical way to reduce the risk of overfitting is to evaluate the model using a separate test dataset.


**By splitting the original dataset into a training dataset (70-80%) and a test dataset (20-30%)**, we can effectively identify overfitting issues.

**IMPLEMENTING THE SOLUTION**

In the "Data Transformation" section, find the "Split Data" module and adjust the settings to create an 80/20 split.

Then, connect the dataset to the Split Data module and proceed to evaluate the model.

By evaluating the model using data that it didn't see during the training phase, we were able to identify and address the overfitting problem.


Remember, accurate evaluation is key in machine learning.

### 4 Cleaning missing data

Let's dive into cleaning missing data to see how it can boost your model's performance.

* **IDENTIFYING MISSING DATA**

First, let's identify the missing data.

We'll explore the dataset and find columns with missing values, like the 'normalized-losses' and 'price' columns.

**CLEANING PROCESS**

Next, we'll clean the data using modules like **'Select Columns in Dataset' and 'Clean Missing Data**'.


We'll exclude the 'normalized-losses' column and remove rows with missing prices.

**RESULTS**

After running the pipeline, the accuracy jumped from 93.5% to 95.1%!

**It's clear that cleaning missing data can significantly enhance your model's accuracy.**

Experimenting with different cleaning methods is key to finding the best approach for your model.

### 5 Deploy our machine learning model for predictions

**CREATING THE INFERENCE PIPELINE**

* To get started, we'll create a **real-time inference pipeline.**
* **This will allow us to submit new data and receive predictions in real-time**.

**SETTING UP THE DEPLOYMENT TARGET**

* Next, we'll create a deployment target, a **compute cluster that will run the inference pipeline**.
* We'll select the region and virtual machine size suitable for our needs.

**DEPLOYING THE MODEL**

* After creating the inference cluster, we'll deploy the real-time inference pipeline to it.
* This may take a while, but once it's ready, we can move on to testing.

* **TESTING THE MODEL**

* In the testing phase, we'll input new data or use the automatically filled fields to see the model's predictions.
* Once satisfied, we'll learn how to call the endpoint from our applications.

### Training and deploying a model

Let's dive into the different compute and deployment targets you can choose from to optimize your model's performance.

* **COMPUTE TARGETS**

When training a model, you have the choice of **<mark>compute instances, compute clusters, and attached compute</mark>**.

Compute instances are individual virtual machines, with the option to select the size and type of processing unit - CPUs or GPUs.


**GPUs are particularly beneficial for deep learning models due to their ability to perform a large number of computations simultaneously.**

If a single compute instance isn't fast enough, a compute cluster, such as an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster, can be utilized for scalability.

* **DEPLOYMENT TARGETS**

For deployment, the default option in the Machine Learning Designer is an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

However, **if using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, numerous other options are available, including Azure Container Instances, Azure Functions, and Azure IoT Edge**.

And that's a wrap on the various compute and deployment targets you can leverage for your model training and deployment.

### ADDING CUSTOM CODE

Learn how to add custom code to your Azure Machine Learning pipelines using the "Execute Python Script" module.

**CUSTOM CODE**

To add your own code to a pipeline, you can use the "Execute Python Script" module.

This module allows you to import additional Python resources via a zip bundle and has two output ports for results datasets.

**FLEXIBILITY**

You have the flexibility to input and output data using your Python code.

For instance, you can send output directly to Azure Storage.

**However, if you're building a pipeline with multiple modules, you'll need to use at least one input and one output port**.

**DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**

Remember, the Designer doesn't provide tools for development and debugging, 

so it's recommended to do your development in a different environment and then paste the code into the module.

* **UTTERANCES**

An utterance is an example of something a user might say, and which your application must interpret.

For example, when using a home automation system, a user might use the following: "Switch the fan on" or "Turn on the light."

**ENTITIES**

An entitv is an item to which an utterance refers.

For example, "fan" and "light" are entities in the utterances "Switch the fan on" and "Turn on the light."

**INTENTS**

An intent represents the purpose, or goal, expressed in a user's utterance.

For example, the intent for the utterances "Switch the fan on" and "Turn on the light" is to turn a device on.

After defining the entities and intents with sample utterances in your conversational language understanding application, you can train a language model to predict intents and entities from user input - even if it doesn't match the sample utterances exactly.

### Conversational language understanding in Azure

**AUTHORING A MODEL**

To begin, you'll define entities, intents, and utterances as part of authoring a model.

This step sets the foundation for generating predictions and creating a robust language understanding model.

**TRAINING THE MODEL**

Once the model is defined, the next step is training.

This process involves using sample utterances to teach the model to recognize natural language expressions and match them to probable intents and entities.

Training and testing is an iterative process, ensuring the model is fine-tuned for accuracy.

**PREDICTING**

After successful training and testing, it's time to publish your Conversational Language Understanding application to a prediction resource for consumption.

Client applications can then connect to the endpoint and submit user input to receive predicted intents and entities.

![Alt Image Text](../images/ai900_2_6.png "Body image")

Box 1: Reliability and safety - To build trust, it's critical that AI systems operate reliably, safely, and consistently under normal circumstances and in unexpected conditions. These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.


Box 2: Accountability - The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. 

These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems.

Box 3: Privacy and security - As AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business  information is becoming more critical and complex. 

With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with privacy laws that require transparency collection，use，and storage if data and mandate that  consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used

27) You run a charity event that involves posting photos of people wearing sunglasses on Twitter.

You need to ensure that you only retweet photos that meet the following requirements:

* Include one or more faces.
* Contain at least one person wearing sunglasses.

What should you use to analyze the images?

* A. the Verify operation in the Face service
* **B. the Detect operation in the Face service**
* C. the Describe Image operation in the Computer Vision service
* D. the Analyze Image operation in the Computer Vision service

**Correct Answer: B**

Face detection is required as a first step in all the other scenarios. The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. 

This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces. Optionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age,emotion, facial hair, and glasses. 

These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to
ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, yourapplication could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses.

28) Which of the following statements are true about the data used to train and evaluate machine learning model？

* **A. You should split the data set into two datasets; one dataset is used to train the model, and the other dataset to evaluate the model.**
* B. You should always use the same data to evaluate the model that you used to train it.
* C. The only time you need to split a dataset into training and test sets is when using a regression algorithm.
* D. When splitting a dataset into training and test datasets, the data should remain in order with the first 70-80% of the data included in the training dataset, and the remaining rows in the test dataset.

**Correct Answer: A**

When training and evaluating a new machine learning model, it is important to split the dataset into a training and test data set. The training dataset is used to train the model, and the test dataset is used to evaluate the model. 

When splitting the data, the rows in the dataset should be selected randomly for the split operation. As a rule of thumb, 70-80%
of the data goes to the training dataset, with the remaining data added to the test dataset.

What should you use as a feature?


* A. the number of taxi journeys in the dataset
* **B. the trip distance of individual taxi journeys**
* C. the fare of individual taxi journeys
* D. the trip ID of individual taxi journeys

Correct Answer: B

The label is the column you want to predict. The identified Features are the inputs you give the model to predict the Label.

Example:

The provided data set contains the following columns:

* `vendor_id`: The ID of the taxi vendor is a feature.
* `rate_code`: The rate type of the taxi trip is a feature.
* `passenger_count`: The number of passengers on the trip is a feature. 
* `trip_time_in_secs:` The amount of time the trip took.


You want to predict the fare of the trip before the trip is completed. 

At that moment, you don't know how long the trip would take. Thus, the trip time is not a feature and you'll exclude this column from the model. 

* `trip_distance`: The distance of the trip is a feature. payment_type: The payment method (cash or credit card) is a feature. 

* `fare_amount`: The total taxi fare paid is the label.

Which type of computer vision should you use?

* A. optical character recognition (OCR)
* **B. object detection**
* C. image classification
* D. face detection


Correct Answer: B


Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each object found.

For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. 

You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.


The Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like "indoor", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.

Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.


Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission.

Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.

**Box 1: verification - Identity verification**

Modern enterprises and apps can use the Face identification and Face verification operations to verify that a user is who they claim to be.

**Box 2: similarity** - The Find Similar operation does face matching between a target face and a set of candidate faces, finding a smaller set of faces that look similar to the target face. This is useful for doing a face search by image.

The service supports two working modes, matchPerson and matchFace. The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that mav or mav not belong to the same person.


**Box 3: identification** - Face identification can address "one-to-many" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scapario is
used in granting building or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.
