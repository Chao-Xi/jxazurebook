1.Which AI service should you use to create a bot from a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document?

* **a) QnA Maker**
* b) Language Understanding (LUIS)
* c) Text Analytics
* d) Speech Text


Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based conversational Al service that applies custom machine learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning and pull out relevant, detailed information.

> A newer version of Language Understanding capabilities are now available as part of Azure Cognitive Service for Language.

Text analytics is used for deeper insights, like identifying a pattern or trend from the unstructured text.

> For example, text analytics can be used to understand a negative spike in the customer experience or popularity of a product,

The Azure speech-to-text service analyzes audio in real-time or batch to transcribe the spoken word into text.


> Out of the box, speech to text utilizes a Universal Language Model as a base model that is trained with Microsoft-owned data and reflects commonly used spoken language.


2  You build a machine learning model by using the automated machine learning user interface (UI).

You need to ensure that the model meets the Microsoft transparency principle for responsible Al.

What should you do?


* a) Set Validation type to Auto.
* **b) Enable Explain best model.**
* c) Set Primary metric to accuracy.
* d) Set Max concurrent iterations to 0

Model Explain Ability.

Most businesses run on trust and being able to open the ML black box. 

This helps build transparency and trust. In heavily regulated industries like healthcare and banking, it is critical to comply with regulations and best practices. One key aspect of this is understanding the relationship between input variables (features) and model output. 

Knowing both the magnitude and direction of the impact each feature (feature importance) has on the predicted value helps better understand and explain the
model. 

**With model explain ability, we enable you to understand feature importance as part of automated ML runs.**
